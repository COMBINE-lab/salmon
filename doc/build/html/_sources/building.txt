Requirements
============

* A C++11 conformant compiler (currently tested with GCC>=4.7 and Clang>=3.4)
* CMake_. Sailfish uses the CMake build system to check, fetch and install
  dependencies, and to compile and install Sailfish. CMake is available for all
  major platforms (though Sailfish is currently unsupported on Windows.)
  
Installation
============

After downloading the Sailfish source distribution and unpacking it, change into the top-level directory:

::

    > cd Sailfish

Then, create and out-of-source build directory and change into it:

::

    > mkdir build
    > cd build


Sailfish makes extensive use of Boost_.  We recommend installing the most
recent version (1.55) systemwide if possible. If Boost is not installed on your
system, the build process will fetch, compile and install it locally.  However,
if you already have a recent version of Boost available on your system, it make
sense to tell the build system to use that.

If you have Boost installed you can tell CMake where to look for it. Likewise,
if you already have `Intel's Threading Building Blocks
<http://threadingbuildingblocks.org/>`_ library installed, you can tell CMake
where it is as well. The flags for CMake are as follows:

* -DFETCH_BOOST=TRUE --  If you don't have Boost installed (or have an older
  version of it), you can provide the FETCH_BOOST flag instead of the
  BOOST_ROOT variable, which will cause CMake to fetch and build Boost locally.

* -DBOOST_ROOT=<boostdir> -- Tells CMake where an existing installtion of Boost
  resides, and looks for the appropritate version in <boostdir>.  This is the
  top-level directory where Boost is installed (e.g. /opt/local).

* -DTBB_INSTALL_DIR=<tbbroot> -- Tells CMake where an existing installation of
  Intel's TBB is installed (<tbbroot>), and looks for the apropriate headers
  and libraries there. This is the top-level directory where TBB is installed
  (e.g. /opt/local).

* -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install_dir> -- <install_dir> is the directory to
  which you wish Sailfish to be installed.  If you don't specify this option,
  it will be installed locally in the top-level directory (i.e. the directory
  directly above "build").
                                  
Setting the appropriate flags, you can then run the CMake configure step as
follows:

::
                                  
    > cmake [FLAGS] ..

The above command is the cmake configuration step, which *should* complain if
anything goes wrong.  Next, you have to run the build step. Depending on what
libraries need to be fetched and installed, this could take a while
(specifically if the installation needs to install Boost).  To start the build,
just run make.

::

    > make

If the build is successful, the appropriate executables and libraries should be
created. There are two points to note about the build process.  First, if the
build system is downloading and compiling boost, you may see a large number of
warnings during compilation; these are normal.  Second, note that CMake has
colored output by default, and the steps which create or link libraries are
printed in red.  This is the color chosen by CMake for linking messages, and
does not denote an error in the build process. 
                                  
Finally, after everything is built, the libraries and executable can be
installed with:

::
                                  
    > make install

To ensure that Sailfish has access to the appropriate libraries you should
ensure that the PATH variabile contains <install_dir>/bin, and that
LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH on OSX) contains
<install_dir>/lib.

After the paths are set, you can test the installation by running

::

    > make test

This should run a simple test and tell you if it succeeded or not.

Running Sailfish
================

Sailfish is a tool for transcript quantification from RNA-seq data.  It
requires a set of target transcripts (either from a reference or _de-novo_
assembly) to quantify.  All you need to run Sailfish is a fasta file containing
your reference transcripts and a (set of) fasta/fastq file(s) containing your
reads.  Sailfish runs in two phases; indexing and quantification.  The indexing
step is independent of the reads, and only need to be run one for a particular
set of reference transcripts and choice of k (the k-mer size). The
quantification step, obviously, is specific to the set of RNA-seq reads and is
thus run more frequently. For a more complete description of all available
options in Sailfish, see the manual.


Indexing
--------

To generate the Sailfish index for your reference set of transcripts, you
should run the following command:

::                                  
    > sailfish index -t <ref_transcripts> -o <out_dir> -k <kmer_len>


This will build a Sailfish index for k-mers of length \<kmer_len\> for the
reference transcripts  provided in the file \<ref_transcripts\> and place the
index under the directory \<out_dir\>.  There  are additional options that can
be passed to the Sailfish indexer (e.g. the number of threads to use).  These
can be seen by executing the command "Sailfish index -h".

Quantification
--------------

Now that you have generated the Sailfish index (say that it's the directory
<index_dir> --- this corresponds to the <out_dir> argument provided in the
previous step), you can quantify the transcript expression for a given set of
reads.  To perform the quantification, you run a command like the following:

::                                 
    
    > sailfish quant -i <index_dir> -l "<libtype>" {-r <unmated> | -1 <mates1> -2 <mates2>} -o <quant_dir>

Where <index_dir> is, as described above, the location of the sailfish index,
<libtype> is a string describing the format of the read library (see the
[library string](#library-string) section below) <unmated> is a list of files
containing unmated reads, <mates{1,2}> are lists of files containg,
respectively, the first and second mates of paired-end reads.  Finally,
<quant_dir> is the directory where the output should be written. Just like the
indexing step, additional options are available, and can be viewed by running
"sailfish quant -h".

When the quantification step is finished, the directory \<quant_dir\> will
contain a file named "quant.sf" (and, if bias correction is enabled, an
additional file names "quant_bias_corrected.sf").  This file contains the
result of the Sailfish quantification step.  This file contains a number of
columns (which are listed in the last of the header lines beginning with '#').
Specifically, the columns are (1) Transcript ID, (2) Transcript Length, (3)
Transcripts per Million (TPM), (4) Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads
(RPKM), (5) K-mers Per Kilobase per Million mapped k-mers (KPKM), (6) Estimated
number of k-mers (an estimate of the number of k-mers drawn from this
transcript given the transcript's relative abundance and length) and (7)
Estimated number of reads (an estimate of the number of reads drawn from this
transcript given the transcript's relative abnundance and length).  The first
two columns are self-explanatory, the next four are measures of transcript
abundance and the final is a commonly used input for differential expression
tools.  The Transcripts per Million quantification number is computed as
described in [1]_, and is meant as an estimate of the number of transcripts, per
million observed transcripts, originating from each isoform.  Its benefit over
the K/RPKM measure is that it is independent of the mean expressed transcript
length (i.e. if the mean expressed transcript length varies between samples,
for example, this alone can affect differential analysis based on the K/RPKM.)
The RPKM is a classic measure of relative transcript abundance, and is an
estimate of the number of reads per kilobase of transcript (per million mapped
reads) originating from each transcript. The KPKM should closely track the
RPKM, but is defined for very short features which are larger than the chosen
k-mer length but may be shorter than the read length. Typically, you should
prefer the KPKM measure to the RPKM measure, since the k-mer is the most
natural unit of coverage for Sailfish.
