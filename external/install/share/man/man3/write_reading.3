.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
These functions write a \fBRead\fR structure into a trace file. The principle
format support is the SCF format. Although reading is supported for ABI and
ALF, writing is not. Additionally, it is possible to write using the plain
(old) staden format files or as Experiment files. In both these cases only the
sequence component of the trace file will be written.
.LP
When writing as an experiment file the QL, QR and SQ fields are generated from
the \fBRead\fR structure. If we previously created the \fBRead\fR structure
from reading an experiment file then the original experiment file data is also
written. Otherwise EN, ID, LN and LT lines are also generated.
.LP
.B write_reading()
writes a \fBRead\fR structure to the specified filename in the specified
format. Formats available are
.BR TT_SCF ,
.BR TT_PLN and
.BR TT_EXP.
Specifying format \fBTT_ANY\fR will be treated as \fBTT_SCF\fR.
.LP
.B fwrite_reading()
writes a \fBRead\fR structure to the specified FILE pointer in the specified
format. Apart from writing to FILE pointer instead of a filename, the function
is identical to \fBwrite_reading()\fR.

.SH RETURN VALUES
.LP
On successful completion, the \fBwrite_reading()\fR and \fBfwrite_reading()\fR
functions return 0. Otherwise these functions return -1.
