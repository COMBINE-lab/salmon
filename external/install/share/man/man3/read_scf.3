.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
These functions read SCF format trace files. All the functions accepting a
\fBFILE *\fP as an argument assume that the file pointer is at the correct
offset within the file.
.LP
.B read_scf()
reads an entire SCF file into the \fBScf\fR structure (see the
.BR scf (4)
manual page for the details of this structure). The data is read from the
specified file name.
.LP
.B fread_scf()
reads an entire SCF file into the \fBScf\fR structure (see the
.BR scf (4)
manual page for the details of this structure). The data is read from the
specified file pointer, which is neither closed or rewound after the
operation.
.LP
.B read_scf_header()
reads the \fBHeader\fR structure from the specified file pointer.

.SH RETURN VALUES
.LP
On successful completion, the \fBread_scf()\fR and \fBfread_scf()\fR functions
return a pointer to a \fBScf\fR structure. Othewise these functions return a
null pointer.
.LP
On successful completion, the \fBread_scf_header()\fR function returns 0.
Otherwise the function returns -1.
