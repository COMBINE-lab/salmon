The files in these directories are covered by a mixture of compatible
BSD style opensource licences. In summary all this code should be free
of GPL issues and is freely available to do with as you wish.


Most code is copyright Medical Research council and is made available
under this licence:

/*
 * Copyright (c) Medical Research Council 1994. All rights reserved.
 *
 * Permission to use, copy, modify and distribute this software and its
 * documentation for any purpose is hereby granted without fee, provided that

 * This file was written by James Bonfield, Simon Dear, Rodger Staden,
 * as part of the Staden Package at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular
 * Biology, Hills Road, Cambridge, CB2 2QH, United Kingdom.
 *
 * MRC disclaims all warranties with regard to this software.
 */

Later MRC made the entire Staden Package open source under the
3-clause BSD licence. This copyright message is also included,
although it is compatible with the above one.

Newer files and changes are copyright Genome Research Ltd using the
following compatible BSD licence. Disentangling which is which is
somewhat tricky, but it's sufficient to say that work in the CVS/SVN
tree from August 2002 will be bound by the GRL licence instead.

The GRL licence will have author(s) listed too. Note that these are
not the sole authors of the files, but the authors for whom the GRL
licence applies.
