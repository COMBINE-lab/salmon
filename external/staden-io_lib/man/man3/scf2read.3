.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
These functions are used internally by the io library for converting between
the in memory representations of the supported file formats. The \fBRead\fR
structure is the central format so only conversion to and from this structure
is available. Conversions consist of to and from the SCF format and to and
from the Experiment File format.
.LP
.B scf2read()
converts an \fBScf\fR structure into a \fBRead\fR structure. The \fBRead\fR
structure is allocated by the function. The \fBScf\fR structure is left
unchanged.
.LP
.B read2scf()
converts a \fBRead\fR structure into an \fBScf\fR structure. The \fBScf\fR
structure is allocated by the function. The \fBRead\fR structure is left
unchanged.
.LP
.B exp2read()
converts an \fBExp_info\fR structure into a \fBRead\fR structure. The
entryname to use in the EN line type of the Experiment File must be specified.
The \fBRead\fR structure is allocated by the function. The \fBExp_info\fR
structure is left unchanged.
.LP
.B read2exp()
converts a \fBRead\fR structure into an \fBExp_info\fR structure. The
\fBExp_info\fR structure is allocated by the function. The \fBRead\fR
structure is left unchanged.

.SH RETURN VALUES
.LP
On successful completion, the \fBscf2read()\fR and \fBexp2read\fR functions
return a pointer to an allocated \fBRead\fR structure. Otherwise these
functions return NULLRead.
.LP
On successful completion, the \fBread2scf\fR function returns a pointer to an
allocated \fBScf\fR structure. Otherwise this function returns a null pointer.
.LP
On successful completion, the \fBread2exp\fR function returns a pointer to an
allocated \fBExp_info\fR structure. Otherwise this function returns a null
pointer.
