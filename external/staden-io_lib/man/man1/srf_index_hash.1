.PP
.BR srf_index_hash
\- Adds a hash-table index to an SRF file.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBsrf_index_hash\fR  [\fI-c] \fIsrf_archive\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBsrf_index_hash\fR adds and index to an SRF file or replaces an
existing index with a new one. In the case of concatenated SRF files
only the index at the end of a file will be replaced, but internal
indices will not be consulted by SRF tools.
.PP
The index is a hash table indexing the sequence names only. The name
itself does not appear in the index, rather the top 7-bits of a 64-bit
hash key are held in the index along with N-bits used to determine the
hash bucket. This reduces the index size to around 10-15 bytes per
sequence.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
.TP
\fB-c\fR
Check only. This requests that the index is not produced, but the
checks performed during the creation of an index (such as looking for
duplicate sequence names) are still performed.
