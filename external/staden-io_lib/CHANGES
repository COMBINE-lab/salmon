Version 1.14.8 (22nd April 2016)
--------------

* SAM: Small speed up to record parsing.

* CRAM: Scramble now has -p and -P options to control whether to
  force the BAM auxiliary sizes (8 vs 16 vs 32-bit integer quantities)
  rather than reducing to smallest size required, and whether to
  preserve the order of auxiliary tags including RG, NM and MD.

  This latter option requires storing these values verbatim instead of
  regenerating them on-the-fly, but note this only preserves tag order
  with Scramble / Htslib.  Htsjdk will still produce these fields out
  of order.

* CRAM no longer stores data in the CORE block, permitting greater
  flexibility in choosing which fields to decode.  (This change is
  also mirrored in htslib and htsjdk.)

* CRAM: ref.fai files in a different order to @SQ headers should now
  work correctly.

* CRAM required-fields parameters no longer forces quality decoding
  when asking for sequence.

* CRAM: More robustness / safety checks during decoding; itf8 bounds
  checks, running out of memory, bounds checks in BETA codec, and
  more.

* CRAM auto-generated read names are consistent regardless of range
  queries.  They also now match those produced by htslib.

* CRAM: the rANS codec should now be slightly faster at decoding.

* CRAM: there is a newer (faster than vanilla Zlib) crc32
  implementation.  If you are linking against CloudFlare's optimised
  Zlib you should configure with --disable-own-crc to utilise their
  assembly PCLMUL CRC implementation.

* CRAM bug fix: removed potential (but unobserved) possibility of
  8-bit quantities stored as a 16-bit value in BAM being converted
  incorrectly within CRAM.

* CRAM bug fix: fixed field widths for cram_dump and cram_size.

* SAM bug fix: no more complaining about "unknown" sort order.

* A few compiler warnings in cram_dump / cram_size have gone away.
  Many small CRAM code tweaks to aid comparisons to htslib.  It should
  also be easier to build under Microsoft Visual Studio (although no
  project file is provided).


Version 1.14.7 (18th February 2016)
--------------

* Some speed ups to BAM encoding, particularly when using uncompressed
  BAM.

* Scramble now has a lossy read-name method (scramble -n) when
  outputting to CRAM.

* Tidied up the formatting of cram_size.

* Cram_dump now prints up the TD map.

* CRAM bug fix: Scramble -N was sometimes failing when multi-threaded.

* CRAM bug fix: The code once again builds if CRAM_IO_CUSTOM_BUFFERING
  is disabled.

* CRAM bug fix: avoid undefined behaviour in some uses of
  CRAM_OPT_REQUIRED_FIELD (not readily noticable from command line
  tools).

* CRAM bug fix: on very rare cases TLEN could change during decode
  (albeit fixing it) for read-pairs that spanned references.

* CRAM bug fix: CIGAR sequences with more than 2^27 operations are now
  supported.

* CRAM bug fix: fixed an assertion failure triggered with some
  repeated templates.


Version 1.14.6 (6th November 2015)
--------------

* CRAM bug fix, reversing a bug introduced during 1.14.5.  Output from
  cramtools could trigger a crash during decoding with scramble.  This
  happened where a HUFFMAN codec was specified with zero symbols.
  E.g. "DL => HUFFMAN {0, 0}" from cram_dump for a slice where there
  are no D operators in the cigar strings for this slice.


Version 1.14.5 (5th November 2015)
--------------

* Scramble now has a way to control the maximum number of bases per
  slice (default 5Mb), forcing a new slice if this limit is hit before
  hitting the existing max sequences per slice limit.  This improves
  performance on very long read data. (PacBio, ONT, etc)

* Improvements for MacOS X building.

* Removed erroneous debugging output from Scramble.

* Fixed cram_dump so it works on longer sequences, eg PacBio data.

* Fixed cram_size (but not yet cram_dump summary output) to handle
  multi-byte content_ids when reporting which block type is for which
  data series.

* Fixed a bug with multi-slice containers, broken since r3946
  (1.14.1).

* Bug fixes to the libmaus2/biobambam2 interface code.  Part of this
  change includes simplifying how auxiliary tag content_ids are
  assigned for CRAM.

* This io_lib release should now work again when being used by the
  current (albeit 2013) release of Staden Package.


Version 1.14.4 (5th October 2015)
--------------

CRAM changes:

* Fixed a CRAM encoding bug with compression level 6 and above where
  the resulting CRAM file could not be decoded.  This has been in
  existance since 1.13.8 (and possibly 1.13.6 under rarer conditions).

* New scramble option -H to avoid printing header in SAM output.


Version 1.14.3 (29th September 2015)
--------------

CRAM changes:

* Disabled the experimental slice checksum headers (SD and BD *slice*
  tags) as their behaviour is still undefined and not in the CRAM
  specification.  These were left in in error.

* Fixed scram_merge to honour the -R option to specify a region.
  (NB: This isn't really a properly supported tool, but a test of the
  library code.)

* Fixed a bug in decoding memory that caused lzma level 9 compressed
  files to be unable to be decompressed.

* Minor updates to scramble usage text.


Version 1.14.2 (16th September 2015)
--------------

CRAM changes:

* Bug fix to SAM header parsing so that it now permits nul characters.
  (This is a long standing bug.)

* Bug fix to auxiliary tag compression; we failed to correctly cache
  the best codec to use, resulting in slower (but valid) compression
  times.


Version 1.14.1 (10th September 2015)
--------------

CRAM changes:

* Small improvements to compression ratios.  CRAM auxiliary fields are
  now always written to their own blocks. Also now experiment with
  level 1 zlib compression in addition to the required level, as
  on some data series this is the best solution.

* Removed support for writing CRAM version 1.0.  This format was never
  truely spec compliant anyway due to errors with the first
  specification.

* rANS O1 memory allocation is now via malloc rather than the heap,
  permitting building on MacOS X again.

* Fixed crash in multi-threaded decoding if not decoding positional
  data (via cram_required_fields() function).

* Fixed a bug with non-reference encoded CRAMs and indexing.

Version 1.14.0 (10th July 2015)
--------------

* The default CRAM format type is now version 3.0.  You can still
  generate version 2.1 files using scramble -V2.1

* Lots of BAM/CRAM code hardening against I/O errors or corrupted data
  files.  Some have been from visual inspection while many have come
  from automated "american fuzzy lop" fuzz testing.  See the ChangeLog
  for the full list.

* Imperovements to compilation; we now compile with -Wall and this
  should produce no warnings.  Let us know if you get them.  There is
  a configure --disable-warnings option to switch off -Wall.

* CRAM: added mmap support for references.  This can reduce the total
  memory footprint if many instances of scramble are running and also
  reduces I/O when we are using small regions of cached md5
  references.

* CRAM: improved compatibility with Java Cramtools CRC32 checking
  (Cram version 3.0).  We've also now done full integration checking
  between the two implementations to ensure best compatibility with
  version 3.0.

* CRAM: better support for Biobambam/libmaus; provides an in-memory
  buffered alternative to the file descriptor to allow better
  multi-threading performance with libmaus.

* CRAM: we now correctly spot sequence "*" when generating a CRAM file
  so we can correctly export it again (cram version 3.0).  Similarly
  quality "*" is better handled too when being passed on to Cramtools.

* CRAM: bug fixed NM:i tag so it no longer counts hard clips. Also
  fixed NM/MD for sequence "*" and cases where one was previously
  present but not the other.

* CRAM: bug fixed handling unmapped reads with sequence "*".

* CRAM: bug fix to index querying when a read starts precisely on a
  boundary of a cram slice.

* CRAM: fixed the container number of blocks field to be computed
  correctly for multi-slice containers.  (Oddly this didn't actually
  matter for Scramble or Cramtools.)


version 1.13.10 (3rd Mar 2015)
---------------

* Reduced memory coordinate sorted CRAM files with many references per
  slice.

* More error protection for mismatching .fai/@SQ headers.

* Improved handling of alignments off the end of references.


version 1.13.9 (29th Jan 2015)
--------------

* Improved CRAM stats array usage. Previously it could create
  sub-optimal HUFFMAN trees in rare situations. Harmless, but larger
  output than necessary.

* The "configure --enable-custom-buffering" (or --disable-) mode, on
  by default, adds an additional scram_open interface to allow low
  level I/O operations to be externally defined.  This is used within
  Biobambam to replace stdio with custom code supporting an iRODS
  backend. See scram_open_cram_via_callbacks().

* CRAM should now be 100% lossless, barring a few specific broken
  inputs (eg CIGAR strings on unaligned data). If it detects flags,
  pnext or tlen fields that would differ if decoded using the
  read-pairing algorithm built in to scramble's cram decoder then it
  stores the read verbatim to avoid deduplicathing these fields. It
  also has better support for the Supplementary flag.

* Improved support for the Supplementary flags when auto-generating
  SAM flags.

* Fixed an issue where new gcc with -O3 could crash in processing SAM
  due to SIMD vectorisation and unaligned memory accesses.

* Cram_index now works via a pipe, by specifying "-" as the input filename.


version 1.13.8 (12th Jan 2015)
--------------

* The REF_PATH and RAWDATA variable expansion can now handle URLs
  without an explicit URL= component.  It also understands the format
  of URLs and doesn't require a double colon (::) to escape a single
  colon any more.

* Removed a few compiler warnings.

* CRAM: Improved test harness to test Scramble -e and -x.  Fixed an
  issue related to -x not setting RI data series in some cases.

* CRAM: BS:Z and BI:Z now go to separate external blocks, for
  (usually) improved compression.  Also added special blocks for
  IonTorrent ZM:B and FZ:B tags.

* CRAM: Reading CRAM indices is now much faster.  Also fixed a bug
  when doing multiple range queries that fell exactly on CRAM
  container boundaries.

* CRAM: Bug fixes and efficiency improvements to the logic to work out
  which data-series to decode.

* CRAM: Better handling of MD and NM tags when using non-reference
  encoding. Also sped up the MD string generation.

* CRAM: Improved support for dealing with both primary and secondary
  alignments.

* CRAM: Better support for name-sorted data. It worked before, but we
  had too many re-loads of the reference sequence.  Similarly removed
  pointless reference sequence loads when encoding with scramble -x.

* CRAM: Various minor memory leaks removed.

* CRAM: Multi-threading updates.
  Fixed some uninitialised memory accesses causing crashes on
  SPARC/Solaris.  Also fixed issues when using range-requests while
  multi-threading.  Less mutex locking when using name-sorted data.

* CRAM: Removed spurious warnings about lack of EOF block when reading
  older format CRAM files.

* CRAM: Bug fix to the (undocumented) SAM 'd' aux type. Only used here
  because samtools supports it.

* CRAM: Bug fix when attempting to decode 0 bytes from an external
  block.

* CRAM: More support for version 3.0.  The 'b' and 'q' CRAM feature
  codes have been implemented along with better support for the old
  BYTE_ARRAY_LEN encoder.  Support for compressed SAM headers.
  Unified RANS0/RANS1 codecs to RANS (switches order itself).

  EXPERIMENTAL: enable using "scramble -V3.0".

  This has now been cross-validated against Java cram_tools 3.0
  format.  (Note this is incompatible with the v3.0 files produced
  from earlier Scramble.)

* BAM: Added support for CIGAR strings above 65535 elements long. See
  http://sourceforge.net/p/samtools/mailman/message/30672431/

* BAM: Removed buffer overrun in records with no auxiliary data and a
  record length of 1024 or a higher power of 2.

* BAM: Handle newline/carriage-return format files.

* BAM: Bug fixed the bin/index calculation; Now [beg,end) instead of
  [beg,end].

* BAM: Fixed the SAM parser to handle integers between -2billion and
  +4billion. (Incoming change to the SAM spec.)


Version 1.13.7 (30th May 2014)
--------------

* CRAM: Bug fixed the required fields detection code. (It was crashing
  when running scram_flagstat on Cramtools output.)

* CRAM: Bug fix to cram_dump output on files using E_BYTE_ARRAY_*
  codecs.

* BAM/CRAM: Modified the thread-pool to try and minimise the number of
  threads used when the program hits an I/O bottleneck.  This avoids
  CPU auto-frequence-scaling causing slowdowns.


Version 1.13.6 (19th May 2014)
--------------

* CRAM: Major overhaul of how data series are assigned to CORE vs
  EXTERNAL blocks. The net effect is that CRAM file should become
  slightly smaller and also faster for decoding when the decoder only
  needs specific SAM columns.  This has dramatically sped up flagstats.

* CRAM: Selection of compression algorithm for external blocks is now
  more advanced.  We allows specifying multiple compression (eg gzip,
  bzip2, lzma, rANS) and the tool will learn which methods work best
  for which blocks and adapt.  (This matters only for v3.0 CRAM
  specification, so is experimental.)

* Cram_dump should now do a better job of auto-detecting binary vs
  printable text, allowing printing of arbitrary blocks in a
  friendlier fashion.  It also now tracks which block is for which
  data-series and displays these in the summary output.

* Cram_index has been refactored, with the code moving out of the
  program and into the io_lib library. It has also been bug-fixed to
  cope with multiple references packed into a single cram container.

* CRAM: bug fixes
  - The EOF writing code now uses the correct bit stream for value -1.

  - Changing the version with scramble -V wasn't having any effect.

  - The BETA codec now correct honours beta offset value for zero
    length codes. (Previously unused)

  - EOF now returns the correct value when a CRAM file is closed
    before attempting to decode the first sequence. (Ie header only.)

* BAM: bug fixes
  - Adding @SQ lines to a BAM file with no textual representation of
    the SAM header now works.

  - Fixed an issue in multi-threaded decoding, causing rare deadlocks.

* CRAM: experimental changes
  - Further tweaks to the rANS codec used for the version 3 CRAM.
    (Ongoing work, to be used for experimentation only.)


Version 1.13.5 (28th February 2014)
--------------

* CRAM: Fixed two bugs involving reference sequences:

  - When loading a fasta file containing un-folded sequence (all on
    one line) the input data wasn't uppercased. This could lead to
    invalid slice MD5 sums if the fasta file contained lowercase
    sequence.

  - In some situations the MD5 header in the @SQ line would be
    computed on a blank sequence, leading to header errors.


Version 1.13.4 (17th February 2014)
--------------

* BAM: Fixed some buffer overruns in BAM decoding.

* CRAM: Added support for CRAM EOF blocks (new in CRAM v2.1
  specification).  Also improved BAM EOF block checking.  v2.1 is now
  the default output version.

* CRAM: Fixed an error causing multi-threading to take longer for the
  first additional thread.

* CRAM: Improved memory-caching of reference sequences when fetching
  via MD5 path. Also reduced memory used when loading via REF_PATH.

* CRAM: Experimental / alpha quality code for CRAM version 3.0,
  including new codecs (rANS & arithmetic coders) and CRCs.

* CRAM: Small improvements to the bzip2 (-j) mode. It now periodically
  tests bzip2 vs gzip and uses whichever is best rather than forcing
  all compression to go via bzip2.

* CRAM: Fixed crash when handling CRAM files with non-sequential
  reference IDs.

* Scramble: Now supports 8-way quality binning as an output option.

* Index_tar: Fixed debian bug #729276 - buffer overflow.

* Improved Windows building via cross-compilation.


Version 1.13.3 (25th October 2013)
--------------

* Improved robustness of CRAM support.

* Fixed important bugs in CRAM multi-threading support.

* CTF has been removed from io_lib source tree. Use 1.13.2 or older if
  you still need this.

* CRAM now supports the new SAM 0x800 supplementary flag.

* Minor optimisations to CRAM compression levels (-1, -3 etc) so they
  are more distinct.

* Fixed bug with curl timeouts when fetching large traces and/or
  reference sequences.


Version 1.13.2 (25th June 2013)
--------------

* Added multi-threading support for sam/bam/cram I/O.

* New scram_flagstat command, mainly to act as a test harness for
  reading speed.

* Bug fixes and improvements to reference sequence handling, in
  particular when dealing with unsorted data.

* Sped up SAM decoding by about 70%. Also improved robustness of
  header parsing.

* Improved automatic file type detection (scramble).

* The CRAM header block is now padded out with lots of nul characters
  to permit inline editing, although we have no tool or API to do this
  currently. 


Version 1.13.1 (3rd May 2013)
--------------

* CRAM now has support for storing unsorted data and for using
  non-reference based encoding (although this isn't very efficient).

* CRAM can now use the EBI MD5 server: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/cram/md5/%s
  The library will use a colon separated REF_PATH environ (see
  TRACE_PATH for analogous examples) to find references, and if set
  will write a local MD5 cache to REF_CACHE environ.

* Added a rudimentary scram_pileup command, mainly as a test of the
  library.

* CRAM now supports bzip2 encoding, specified using scramble -j.

* Various speed increases.

* Improved BAM support for non-intel hardware.

* Bug fixes to CRAM mate flags in various scenarios.

* Fixes to generation of NM and MD strings.

* Can now code with BAM files containing no text headers; only binary
  @SQ records.

* Can also cope with SAM/BAM files containing no @SQ records at all
  (entirely unmapped).

* More rigorous error checking in BAM/SAM/CRAM code.

* The code is more compatible with linking into samtools (a pilot
  project is ongoing).

* CRAM encoding is more robust to broken CIGAR strings.

* Various bug fixes to cram indexing.

* [API] Various function renaming, to allow this and samtools
  libraries to be linked into the same applications and also for
  tidyness.
    *_next_seq() becomes *_get_seq()
    refs type is now refs_t.
    cram_fd->SAM_hdr is now cram_fd->header
    sam_header_*() becomes sam_hdr_*()

* [API] bam_construct_seq now has a different calling syntax, to make
  it easier for memory allocation.

* [API] Added various auxiliary field construction functions to BAM.

* [API] Setting cram options is now done via a varargs syntax.

* [API] Added extern "C" around headers to permit use by C++.


Version 1.13.0 (21st Mar 2013)
--------------

* Added SAM, BAM and CRAM APIs.

* Added scramble and cram_merge tools using the above APIs.

* Copied in (needs to be "move") dstring, string_alloc and zfio files
  from main Staden Package tree.

* Minor code tidyups to remove warnings from gcc -Wall and from the
  Intel compiler.


Version 1.12.5 (3rd Feb 2011)
--------------

* Fixed detection of requirement for va_copy(); affecting some Mac
  builds.

* Added hash_exp. I'm not sure this is of pratical use, but it was in
  the source tree and in theory at least still works.

* Removed minor memory leak in HashTableResize().



Version 1.12.4 (7th July 2010)
--------------

* Fixed bug added with 1.12.3 in extracting data from .hash files.


Version 1.12.3 (6th July 2010)
--------------

* Resolved compilation problems: endianness and large file support are
  now detected in a wider variety of cases.

* srf2fastq now automatically outputs appropriate calibrated vs
  non-calibrated values without having to explicitly use -c. This
  option is now only needed when both CNF1 and CNF4 ZTR chunks are
  present (it'll default to CNF4).

* srf2fastq no longer forces "." to be reformatted to "N".

* srf_dump_all improvements when facing read names with "#index" from
  tagged runs.

* srf_filter can now act as a pipe, reading from stdin and writing to
  stdout.

* hash_tar can now index multiple tar files together into one .hash
  file. hash_list -l has been extended to list the originating .tar.
  Additionally "hash_tar -m map_file" allows renaming of tar filenames
  prior to indexing, allowing for a hacky way to work around modified
  names, cases, directory layouts, etc.


Version 1.12.2 (15th Jan 2010)
--------------

* Extra options in srf2fastq: -S to output split regions sequentially
  to stdout. -r to request a region to be reverse complemented before
  output.

* API addition
  - Added pooled_alloc.h. This is a general purpose mechanism of
    pooling multiple fixed size memory allocations into fewer malloc()
    library calls.
  - HashTables now have a HASH_POOL_ITEMS option to use the above
    pooling system. This reduces memory wasted and speeds them up.

* Bug fix: Fixed ztr_add_text() so that is leaves two nul bytes on the
  end of TEXT chunks instead of one, as documented in the ZTR
  specification.

* Bug fix: Fixed buffer overrun in parse region chunks; srf2fastq and
  srf2fasta.

* Bug fix: API read_sff_read_data() did not skip ahead to the next
  8-byte boundary.


Version 1.12.1 (7th August 2009)
--------------

* Fixed the endianness detection in io_lib/os.h when used in
  conjuction with auto-conf. This fix allows for "fat" binaries to be
  built on MacOS X.

* Fixed io_lib-config program to use -lstaden-read instead of -lread.


Version 1.12.0 (29th July 2009)
--------------

* Renamed the library from libread.so to libstaden-read.so. This was
  already the case for the Fedora bundled RPM.

* Switched to using libtool to allow building of dynamic libraries.
  Note that this is tweaked to not use -rpath though. Proper library
  versioning has been added too.

* Removed deprecated platform specific tools: illumina2srf,
  srf2illumina.

* Srf_info now reports the compressed size of chunks, sorted by type,
  in addition to their counts. It also correctly sums to over 2Gb now
  for base-call counting.

* Various SRF tools have had the maximum sequence length changed from
  1024 to 10000. This allows for even the most gifting capillary traces.

* API
  - The Array functions now take size_t instead of int for the
    array dimensions. (API CHANGE)

  - Removed the (unused?) pipe2 function from compress.h. This was
    intended to be internal only, and it now clashes with a new linux
    kernel function. (API CHANGE)

  - Added iterators to the HashTable* api.

* Bug fixes

  - Fixed a memory allocation bug in the codes2codeset() function.

  - ztr2read() should now work better on ZTR structs with no BPOS
    chunk.

  - Fixed various srf tools when facing an SRF file containing zero
    chunks in the data block header.

  - index_tar handles some GNU tar extensions better (LongLink).


Version 1.11.6.1 (9th December 2008)
----------------

* Identical except removal of a debugging printf statement in solexa2srf.


Version 1.11.6 (9th December 2008)
--------------

* illumina2srf, srf2illumina, srf2fastq
  - We no longer change from log-odds to phred when storing data in
    SRF, instead preferring to just mark it in correct input
    scale. srf2fastq now honours this scale information and so the
    conversion from log-odd to phred is done at the export stage
    instead. (Chris Saunders)

  - Bug fix to srf2illumina qcal conversion. Combined with above
    changes the qcal output should now be 100% identical to the
    original data input via illumina2srf.

* API
  - New function srf_next_ztr_flags. This is like srf_next_ztr but
    also returns the SRF flags value (good/bad read, etc).

* srf_filter, srf2fastq, srf_info (Steven Leonard)
  - Improved support for multiple index blocks in SRF files, eg from
    manually concatenated files.

  - srf2fastq now sports options for splitting the output into
    multiple fastq files when the input data is a paired-end run.


Version 1.11.5 (3rd December 2008)
--------------

* Illumina2srf
  - Fixed major bug with using *both* -qf and -qr together. The
    quality values for the reverse strand were shifted by one
    character.

  - Fixed qcal quality values so they're not shifted down by 64
    (illumina format fastq).

  - Fixed bugs in parsing directory names if not matching the expected
    format.

* Removed major memory leaks from srf_filter.

* hash_sff now has support for outputting the table of contents to a
  new file rather than appending to an existing sff file or copying
  the entire contents to a new file.

* Various man pages have been added. The list is still incomplete
  though. Additions are most welcome.

* New program: srf_list. This lists and/or counts the number of
  sequences within an SRF file.


Version 1.11.4 (11th September 2008)
--------------

* New "make check" build target to perform some automated tested.
  Currently limited to testing the SRF tools.

* Fixed machine endianness issues. Specifically this resolves known Intel
  MacOS-X problems.

* New SRF tools

  - srf_info: reports simple metrics on the contents of an SRF file.

  - srf_filter: slices and dices the SRF file to produce a new one
    with various types of data removed.

* illumina2srf

  - Minor float/int rounding change when storing int/nse/sig2 data.

  - Improved error detection such that it returns a failure code more
    often given a parsing issue.

  - Added -pf/pr parameters for storing Phasing files.

  - Reduced memory usage, especially on large numbers of clusters per
    tile. We may now produce multiple DBH blocks per tile. Also major
    reduction to memory when handling the .params files.

  - Added storage of 2nd .params file (firecrest).

  - Fixed bug in the automatic base-call version identification.

  - Fixed a bug with using -qf/qr when not providing all tiles (ie not
    starting from tile number 1).

  - Bug fix with storing the reverse matrix file in paired-end runs; a
    duplicate of the forward one was being used instead.

* General SRF

  - Improved error checking in srf_index_hash. It now spots duplicate
    reads and also has a -c option to check an existing SRF file
    without writing the index.

  - Fixed a memory leak in srf_next_ztr(), triggered in srf2fastq -C.

Version 1.11.3 (9th July 2008)
--------------

* illumina2srf change:

  - IMPORTANT bug fix to illumina2srf when using the "-r" flag to
    store raw (.int and .nse) data. This could often result in
    corrupting the data ZTR meta-data for the SMP4 chunks resulting in
    confusion over which trace channels are raw and which are
    processed.

    Fortunately the corruption is reversable. For more details and a
    fix see the ssrformat announcement of the issue:

    http://www.bcgsc.ca/pipermail/ssrformat/2008-July/000531.html

* General SRF changes:

  - Removed a memory leak in ztr_find_chunks().

  - Added SRFB_NULL_INDEX as an SRF block type. This provides a more
    transparent way to skip over the 8 zero value bytes that may exist
    at the end of an SRF file missing an index block.

* Other changes

  - Fixed a bug in extract_seq when operating on multiple files and
    outputting to a file rather than a pipe. An erroneous seek in the
    mFILE code lead to it repeatedly truncating the output, resulting
    in one sequence file at the end instead of multiple files.


Version 1.11.2 (4th June 2008)
--------------

* solexa2srf/srf2solexa changes:

  - Renamed to illumina2srf/srf2illumina.

  - Incorporated support the IPAR format (Come Raczy, Illumina).

  - Added support for qcal format data (Come Raczy).

  - Added -C option to tag data as failing the chastity filter, but it
    is still included in the SRF output (Camil Toma).

  - Many more additional features added to srf_dump_all provided by
    Camil Toma. It somewhat overlaps srf2solexa now, but may still
    have it's own use.

  - Ztr TEXT chunks now output in srf2solexa.

  - Improved ways to specify matrices (-mf/-mr) in solexa2srf.

  - solexa2srf is substantially faster when reading gzipped files.

  - The -N/-n naming scheme options for solexa2srf now default to the
    same conventions used by GERALD. Added additional %d, %m and %r
    format rules too.

  - Calibrated confidence values are now output if -qf or -qr
    paramaters are used, in addition to uncalibrated ones. These are
    stored in phred scale in a CNF1 ZTR chunk.

* srf2fastq now has a -c option to output calibrated confidence values
  (if present). It also supports multiple archives on the command line.

* SRF fixes:

  - Better handling of full pathnames in solexa2srf.

  - Use binary IO mode; fixes bugs on Windows.

  - Fixed an error where some chunks were not compressed properly
    (valid still, just not compressed).

  - Removed memory corruption in solexa2srf (in rare cases).

  - Fixed bug with binary formatted read_id suffixes (fixed by
    Cristian Goina).

  - Initialised memory in hash table code (used in indexing amongst
    other things).

  - Indexes very occasionally failed to find a trace that did infact
    exist. 

  - Removed memory leak in construct_trace_name (patch from John
    Emhoff, Helicos).

  - Fixed reading of XML block in srf_read_xml(). From John Emhoff.


* Added SRF= format string to TRACE_PATH to facilitate on-the-fly
  extraction from indexed SRF files. This means io_lib can now
  transparently pull traces from an archive or treat it as if it was a
  directory - eg "foo.srf/IL15_..._123:456".

* Bug fix (SF-1898427) - now builds on Fedora.

* Better handling of 64-bit file size sensing in autoconf.


Version 1.11.1 (not officially released - internal testing only)
--------------

Version 1.11.0 (20th February 2008)
--------------

First official release of v1.11.0 and SRF support.

* Further speed improvements to solexa2srf.

* Added extract_qual program (analogous to extract_seq).

* Added new srf2fasta program and also sped up srf2fastq by 25%.

* Solexa2srf now supports storing the raw .int/.nse trace data instead
  of or in addition to the processed .sig2 data. 

* Solexa2srf now stores enough to reproduce sufficient firecrest
  output to rerun the solexa basecaller. Specifically that's a couple
  matrix files and 'region' data for paired end runs.

* Minor changes / bug fixes:

  - extract_seq no longer attempts to gzip the output by default if
    the input was gzipped

  - ztr2read conversion (eg visible in trace_dump) now correctly
    handles ZTR files with multiple SMP4 chunks.

  - Fixed memory leaks in various bits of SRF code (srf_extract_linear
    mainly and srf_index_hash).


Version 1.11.0b8 (25th January 2008)
----------------

(Hopefully final beta test of SRF code before official 1.11.0 release.)

* Bug fixed the index format. We incorrectly handled null dbhFile and
  containerFile elements plus incorrectly computing the index size.

* Improvements for solexa2srf code.
  - Can store raw vs processed data
  - Stores matrix and .params contents.
  - Optional chastity filtering.
  - Input data may now be gzipped.

* Minor fixes to output of trace_dump and ztr_dump.

* Minor srf_index_hash bug fixes (when dealing with concatenated
  indexed files).


Version 1.11.0b7 (11th January 2008)
----------------

* IMPORTANT bug fix to the SRF format. The Data Block Header had the
  blocksize field 4 bytes too large. Now fixed. Old SRF files will not
  be readable by this new code (as they were in error).


Version 1.11.0b6 (2nd January 2008)
----------------

* Changes to adhere to SRF v1.3:

* Removal of the readID counter.

* Added support for printf style name formatting.

* Minor index format tweaks (64-bit data, dch/container filenames).
  Index format is therefore now 1.01.


Version 1.11.0b5 (8th November 2007)
----------------

* Major reorganisation of directories. All library code is in subdir
  "io_lib". The code now uses "io_lib/xxx.h" in all include statements
  too.

* Fixed memory leaks in ZTR code

* Various SRF bug fixes and better support for sample OFFS metadata in
  both ZTR/ZTR.

* Added srf_extract_hash program to perform random-access on a hash
  indexed SRF archive.


Version 1.11.0b4 (26th October 2007)
----------------

* The SRF format now supported adheres to version 1.2.

* More speedups, in particular focusing on uncompression this time, so
  srf2solexa is an order of magnitude faster.

* ztr2read() now honours the read_sections() options and so is much
  faster when only decoding (say) base and quality values.

* New program srf2fastq.

* Internal changes to various ztr data structures. If you use these
  yourself take note of the new ztr_owns fields to avoid memory leaks.


Version 1.11.0b3 (16th October 2007)
----------------

* Major speed improvements for compression. solexa2srf is now 30-35x faster.

* Fixed various buffer overruns and memory leaks reported by valgrind
  in the new deflate interlaced and SRF code.


Version 1.11.0b2 (2nd October 2007)
----------------

* Minor version change to fix typoes in Makefile system.


Version 1.11.0b1 (28th September 2007)
----------------

Beta release 1.

* Added preliminary SRF support. This consists of a new	subdirectory
 'srf' (yes these all really need merging into a single directory,
 but that's a later task), a substantial update to ZTR and a variety
 of SRF tools in progs.

 The old huffman_static.[ch] files were renamed and substantially
 worked upon to create deflate_interlaced.[ch].

 Added new compression types. xrle2, tshift and qshift. The latter two
 of these are very specific to trace and quality packings. May need to
 rename to be more generic.


Version 1.10.3 (???)
--------------

* The HashTable interface now also allows for Bob Jenkins' lookup3
  64-bit hash function. This allows for substantially larger hash
  tables.

* Replaced tempnam() with tmpfile(). On systems without tmpfile
  (Windows) this is simply a wrapper to use the old tempnam calls.

* hash_extract bug fix for windows: now operates in binary mode.

* INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: On windows we now use semi-colon as the path
  separator. The reason is that with the MinGW getenv() seems to do
  "clever things" with PATH variables and consequently ends up
  corrupting our clumsy attempt of escaping colons in paths.

* Fasta format is semi-supported in "plain" format. It returns the
  first entry when reading.

* Experimental support for static huffman (STHUFF) compression type.


Version 1.10.2 (30th May 2007)
--------------

Primarily this is a bug fix release.

* Convert_trace now has -signed and -noneg options to control signed
  vs unsigned issues when shifting trace data about.

* Include files now have C++ extern "C" style guards around them.

* Various programs now accept -ztr command line arguments to force ZTR
  format reading. This is for consistencies sake only and it is
  recommended that users simply let the programs automatically detect
  the file formats.

* Hash_exp now outputs to the same file containing the experiment
  files (in appended hash-table mode). It also has better Windows
  handling (stripping ^M and using binary mode).

* hash_extract bug fix: now only needs at least 1 filename specified
  when fofn mode is not in use.

* mFILE emulation: bug fixes when dealing with ftruncate, append mode,
  checking for read/write flags, new mfcreate_from() function.

* ZTR: added an experimental ZTR_FORM_STHUFF compression scheme. This
  uses static huffman encoding on a predefined hard-coded set of
  huffman tables. The purpose (as yet not put into action) is to allow
  efficient compression of very small data sets for Illumina, AB
  SOLiD, etc style traces.


Version 1.10.1 (20th June 2006)
--------------

* Trace files are now opened in read-only mode by default
  (open_trace_file func).


Version 1.10.0 (15th June 2006)
--------------

* Two new environment variables are used, EXP_PATH and TRACE_PATH, to
  replace RAWDATA. EXP_PATH is used when the new open_exp_mfile()
  function is called and TRACE_PATH is used when open_trace_mfile() is
  called. Both default to using RAWDATA when EXP or TRACE env is now
  found. Also defined a trace type TT_ANYTR which is analogous to the
  existing TT_ANY except it will not look for experiment or plain
  format files.

  Modified the various example programs to use the appropriate open
  call. This allows for traces and experiment files to have identical
  names, such as is usually the case when querying named trace objects
  from a trace server.

* New program: extract_fastq to generate FASTQ output format.

* New program: hash_exp. This allows multiple experiment files to be
  contatenated together and then indexed so io_lib can still treat
  them as single files.

* The URL based search path mechanism now by default uses libcurl
  instead of wget. This makes it considerably faster.

* If an element in RAWDATA, EXP_PATH or TRACE_PATH now starts with the
  pipe symbol ("|") then the compressed file extension code is negated
  for that search element. (This prevents looking for foo.gz, foo.Z,
  foo.bz2, etc if it fails to find foo.)

* Added HashTableDel() and HashTableRemove() functions to take items
  out of a hash table.

* ZTR's compress_chunk() and uncompress_chunk() functions are now
  externally callable.

* New program io_lib-config. This has --version, --cflags and --libs
  options to query the appropriate configuration when compiling and
  linking against io_lib. There's also a new io_lib.m4 file which
  provides an AC_CHECK_IO_LIB autoconf macro to use io_lib-config and
  generate appropriate Makefile substitutions.

* Updated the autoconf code to support libcurl searching.

* Renamed SCF's delta_samples[12] functions to be
  scf_delta_samples[12]. (From Saul Kravitz)

* Added a '-error filename' option to convert_trace. (From Saul Kravitz)

* Bug fix: HashTableAdd() now works properly with non-string keys.

* Bug fix to read_dup().

* Bug fix to xrle which could read past the array bounds. It also now
  handles run-lengths of 256 or more.

* Bug fix: the fwrite_* functions no longer close the FILE pointer
  given to them.

* Bug fix to fdetermine_trace_type(); it now rewinds the file back.

* Bug fix to mfseek and mrewind; they both now clear the EOF flag.

* Bug fix to find_file_dir().


Version 1.9.2 (14th December 2005)
-------------

* Added AC_CHECK_LIB calls for the nsl and socket libraries
  (gethostbyname / socket functions). Needed for Solaris compilations.

* In extract_seq, used open_trace_mfile instead of
  open_trace_file. Functionally this is the same, but it is faster.

* fwrite_reading() now frees the temporary mFILE it created.

* mfreopen_compressed() no longer closes the original FILE
  pointer. This brings it back into line with the original
  functionality provided in 1.8.x. It also cures a bug where the old
  file pointer was often left opening meaning operates on many files
  could could cause a resource leak ending in the inability to open
  more trace files.

* Added private_data and private_size to the Read struct. Populate
  these when reading SCF files.

* Hash_extract now returns an error code to the calling process upon
  failure.

* Major overhaul of hash_sff. It no longer loads the entire file into
  memory. It can now cope with adding a hash index to an archive that
  already contains an index.

* Added support for 454's "sorted index" code. NB this is based on the
  extraction code from their getsff.c code and has not been tested
  with a genuine indexed SFF file yet.

* Fixed an uninitialised memory access in mfload().

* Fixed a bug where hash query searches for items that do not exist
  and map to an empty bucket could cause hangs or crashes.

* Fixed a hang in mfload() when reading a zero length file.


Version 1.9.1
-------------

* Implemented the SFF (454) file structure, currently as read-only.
  This is supported both as an archive containing multiple files and
  also as a single SFF entry.

* Allow for SFF=? components in RAWDATA search path.

* Tar files, SFF archives and hashed archives (eg hashed tar, sff, or
  "solid" archives) may now be used as part of a pathname. Eg if a
  tar file foo.tar contains entry xyzzy.ztr then we can ask to fetch
  trace foo.tar/xyzzy.ztr instead of requiring setting of the
  RAWDATA environment variable.

* Changed the HashFile format slightly. It's now format 1.00.
	
  The key difference is that it has a file footer pointing back to the
  hashfile header (so the hashfile can be appended to an archive) and
  it also has an offset in the header to apply to all seeks within the
  archive itself, so it can be prepending to an archive that's already
  been indexed without breaking the offsets.

  Extended the hash_tar program to allow control over these header options.

* Fixed divide-by-zero buf when calling mfread for zero

* Removed the warning for unknown ZTR chunk types. It now just
  silently stores them in memory. 

* mfopen now honours binary verses ascii differences (and so updated
  Read.c calls accordingly) so that Windows works better.

* Removed file descriptor 'leak' in write_reading(). 

* Unset compression_used when opening uncompressed files instead of
  leaving as the last value.

* Fixed a file descriptor (and some memory) leak in
  freopen_compressed. (Bug ID #1289095) 

* Fixed the hash file saving and loading so that it works on all
  platforms instead of just x86 linux. There were bugs in assuming the
  size of structures. The assumptions are still there in that I assume
  they pad the same internally (for ease of coding - we can change it
  when we finally see a system which operates differently), but the
  final "boundary" padding has been resolved.


Version 1.9.0
-------------

* ***INCOMPATIBILITIES*** to 1.8.12

  - The Exp_info structure now internally contains an "mFILE *" member
    instead of "FILE *" member. If you use the experiment file functions
    for I/O then hopefully it'll still work. However if you directly
    manipulated the Exp_info yourself using fprintf etc then you will
    need to modify your code.
  
  - Some functions no longer have external scope. Most of these did not
    previously have external function prototypes. If you have a burning
    need to use one of these, please contact me directly via sourceforge.
    The full list is:
  
      ctfType (global variable)            ztr_encode_samples_C         
      replace_nl                           ztr_encode_samples_G    
      ctfDecorrelate                       ztr_encode_samples_T    
      exp_print_line_                      ztr_decode_samples              
      find_file_tar                        ztr_encode_bases                
      find_file_archive                    ztr_decode_bases                
      find_file_url                        ztr_encode_positions

      uncompress_chunk                     ztr_encode_text                 
      ztr_encode_samples_4                 ztr_decode_text                 
      ztr_decode_samples_4                 ztr_encode_clips                
      ztr_encode_samples_common            ztr_decode_clips                
      ztr_encode_samples_A                                         
  
  - Some external functions have changed prototypes to use mFILE instead
    of FILE. Most cases of these I've put in place a wrapper function
    with the old name, but not yet all. Functions changed are:
  
      ctfFRead                             write_scf_samples32       
      ctfFWrite                            write_scf_base       
      exp_print_line                       write_scf_bases      
      exp_print_mline                      write_scf_bases3     
      exp_print_seq                        write_scf_comment            
      read_scf_header                      fcompress_file       
      read_scf_sample1                     fopen_compressed     
      read_scf_samples1                    freopen_compressed           
      read_scf_samples31                   be_write_int_1       
      read_scf_sample2                     be_write_int_2       
      read_scf_samples2                    be_write_int_4       
      read_scf_samples32                   be_read_int_1                
      read_scf_base                        be_read_int_2                
      read_scf_bases                       be_read_int_4                
      read_scf_bases3                      le_write_int_1       
      read_scf_comment                     le_write_int_2       
      write_scf_header                     le_write_int_4       
      write_scf_sample1                    le_read_int_1                
      write_scf_samples1                   le_read_int_2                
      write_scf_samples31                  le_read_int_4                
      write_scf_samples2                   fdetermine_trace_type        
  
  - Removed support for the OLD unix "pack" program as a valid trace
    compression algorithm.
  
  - Removed CORBA support. (It wasn't enabled and I've no idea if it
    even worked as I cannot test it.)
  
  - The default search order for RAWDATA now has the current working
    directory at the end of RAWDATA instead of the start.
  
* Significant speed ups, particularly when dealing with reading
  gzipped files or when extracting data from tar files.

* New external functions for faster access via mFILE (memory-file)
  structs. These mimic the fread/fwrite calls, but with mfread/mfwrite
  etc.

* Numerous minor tweaks and updates to fix compiler warnings on more
  stricter modes of the Intel C Compiler.

* Preliminary support for storing pyrosequencing style traces. This
  has been modeled on the flowgram data from 454, but should be
  applicable to other platforms. ZTR has been updated to incorporate
  this too.

  The Read structure also has flow, flow_order, nflows and flow_raw
  elements too. Code to convert these into the more usual traceA/C/G/T
  arrays exists currently as part of Trev (in tk_utils in the Staden
  Package), but this may move into io_lib for the next official release.

* New hash_tar and hash_extract programs. These replace the index_tar
  program for rast random access. For RAWDATA include "HASH=hashfile"
  as an element to get io_lib to use the archive hash. It's possible
  to create hash files of most archive formats as the hash itself
  contains the offset and size of each item in the archive. This means
  that extracting an item does not need to know the format of the
  original archive.

  Some benchmarks show that on ext3 it's actually faster to extract
  files from the hash than directly via the directory. This was
  testing with ~200,000 files, whereupon directory lookups become
  slow. I'd imagine ResierFS or similar to be faster.

* Added an XRLE encoding for ZTR. This is similar to the existing RLE
  mechanism but it copes with run length encoding of items larger than
  a single byte. It's current use is for storing the 4-base repeating
  flow order in 454 data.


Version 1.8.12
--------------

* The ABI format code now reads the confidence values from KB (via
  PCON field).

* New program: trace_dump. Like scf_dump, but deals with generic input
  formats.

* Slightly more sensible average spacing calculation in the ABI
  reading code. It's still not perfect, but is only used when the real
  spacing value is negative or zero.

* Disabled the base-reordering fix for ABI files. We believe the bug
  causing this no longer exists.

* Expriment file format: added FT (EMBL feature table) and LF
  (LiGation; a combination of LI and LE) records.

* Experiment files: strip out digits from the sequence we read
  (for better support of EMBL files).

* Experiment files: fixed a potential buffer overrun in the conversion
  of binary confidence values to ascii values.

* Minor improvements to portability (INT_MAX vs MAXINT2) and removal
  of some compilation warnings.

* Extract_seq now accepts a -fofn argument.

* New functions: read_update_base_positions() and
  read_udpate_confidence_values() to replace read_update_opos().
  These apply an edit buffer to the sequence details and are used (for
  example) within Trev for saving edits back to a trace file.

* Better error handling in fcompress_file().

* New specifiers in RAWDATA. Added a generic URL format (eg
  "URL=http://some/where/trace=%s") implemented via use of wget. There
  is also an ARC= format to make use of the Sanger Trace Archive,
  although currently this will not work externally.

* Zero memory used in read_alloc(). Fixes to read_dup().


Version 1.8.11
--------------

* Rewrote the background subtraction in convert_trace to deal with each
  channel independently.

* Make install now install the include files (all of them, although not all
  are strictly required) in $prefix/include/io_lib/.

* Moved the ABI filter wheel order (FWO) reading from outside the sample
  reading code into the general reading bit as this is needed for reading the
  comments too (it also applies to the order of the signal strengths). Hence
  when the READ_COMMENTS section only is defined it now works correctly.

* Moved the DataCount #defines into static values and added a
  abi_set_data_counts function to change these. This allows reading of the raw
  data from ABI files. This is used within the new convert_trace -abi_data
  option.

* Removed a one-byte write buffer overflow in the CTF writing code.

* New Experiment file records WL and WR for indicating clip points within a WT 
  trace.

* Removed the saved copy of fp for exp_fread_info in 'e' structure as it
  doesn't belong to us. (If we do store it there then the exp_destroy_info
  function will free it and this causes bugs.). POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY:
  if you assumed that exp_destroy_info closed the files that you opened and
  passed into exp_fread_info, then this is no longer true.

* New function read_dup() to copy a Read structure.

* get_read_conf() now deals with loading confidence values from any suitable
  format and not just SCF.

* Fixed memory leak in ztr (ztr->text_segments).


Version 1.8.10
--------------

* Added Steven Leonard's changes to index_tar. It no longer adds index entries
  for directories, unless -d is specified. It also now supports longer names
  using the @LongLink tar extension.

* Fixed a bug in exp2read where the base positions were random if experiment
  files are loaded without referencing a trace and without having ON lines.

* New program get_comment. This queries and extracts text fields held within
  the Read 'info' section

* Overhaul of convert_trace to support the makeSCF options (normalise etc).


Version 1.8.9
-------------

Sorry this isn't a proper changes-by-source listing. Any suggestions for how I 
collate the 'cvs log' output into something more concise? The below text is
simply a list of changes, but more complete than in the NEWS file.

* ZTR spec updated to v1.2. The chebyshev predictor has been rewritten in
  integer format. The old chebyshev still has a format type allocated to it
  (73), but the new ICHEB format (74) is now the default. The old floating
  point method was potentially unstable (eg when running on non IEEE fp
  systems). The new method also seems to save a bit more space.

* The docs and code disagreed for CNF4 storage. Changed the docs to reflect
  the code (which does as intended).

* ZTR speed increase. Follow1 is substantially faster, increasing write
  times by about 10%. 

* New named formats types. ZTR1, ZTR2 and ZTR3. ZTR defaults to ZTR2, but we
  can explicitly ask for another compression level if desired. Also explicit
  statement of format (TT_ZTR instead of TT_ANY) removes the need for
  a rewind() call and so ZTR can now work through a pipe.

* General tidy up to remove a few compilation warnings (missing include files,
  signed vs unsigned issues, etc).

* Initial support is included for BioLIMS integration, but this is not
  complete. (Unfortunately it requires access to a non-public library.)

* New function compress_str2int - opposite of existing compress_int2str.

* (Steven Leonard). Uses zlib for gzip compression and decompression.





These are extracts from the full Staden Package change log. They may not be
immediately obvious when taken out of context, but we feel this information
may still be useful to the users of io_lib.

23rd August 2000, James
-----------------------
1. Removed find_trace_file and added an open_trace_file function.
The idea is that searching for a files existance is better done by attempting
to open it. This in turn allows for more possibilities of file searching.
        Makefile
	utils/open_trace_file.c
	read/Read.c
	read/scf_extras.c
	read/translate.[ch]
	progs/extract_seq.c

2. Added a TAR option to RAWDATA. We can now read trace files directly from
tar files (although they cannot be written to directly).
        utils/open_trace_file.c
	utils/tar_format.h

3. Created an index_tar program to optimise tar reading, although it is not
mandatory.
	progs/index_tar.c
	progs/Makefile

4. Fixed a bug when dealing with plain text files containing spaces.
        plain/seqIOPlain.c


31st July 2000, James
---------------------
1. Renamed TTFF to be ZTR.
	read/Read.[ch]
	utils/traceType.c
	utils/compress.c
	ttff/* -> ztr/*
	README

2. ZTR reading will now stop when it spots a ZTR magic number. This allows
concatenation of ZTR files.
	ztr/ztr.[ch]


15th June 2000, James
---------------------
1. Added a TTFF_FOLLOW filter type to TTFF. This is enabled with compression
level 2 for the chromatogram data.
      io_lib/ttff/ttff.[ch]
      io_lib/ttff/compression.[ch]

9th June 2000, James
--------------------
* RELEASED 1.8.4 */

1. Added zlib bits to windows compilation.
	io_lib/mk/windows.mk

2. Updated convert_trace. It can now reduce sample-size to 8-bit (with the
"-8" option) and the formats may now be specified as either integer or text
format. The text format is case insensitive.
	io_lib/progs/convert_trace.c
	io_lib/utils/traceType.c

3. More windows binary vs ascii fixes. When reading we switch to binary mode
before attempting fdetermine_trace_type, otherwise it fails to auto-detect
TTFF (which includes a newline as part of the magic number). Also added a
_setmode() call to the fwrite_reading code too.
	io_lib/read/Read.c

4. Changed the default compression technique of TTFF to that used in 1.8.2. I
accidently left it set to the experimental dynamic-delta method in 1.8.3,
which currently doesn't have the uncompression function! Also removed lots of
debugging output.
	io_lib/ttff/ttff.c
	io_lib/ttff/ttff_translate.c

5. Bug fix to exp2read - when no right hand quality cutoff is specified we
were defaulting to the left end of the trace, instead of the right end. (This
only happens when opening experiment files which do not have clip points.)
	io_lib/read/translate.c

6. Changed the strftime() format in ABI reading code to use %H:%M:%S instead
of %T, as %T doesn't appear to be part of ANSI (I think it's probably
XPG4-UNIX). It worked on Unix machines, but not on MS Windows.
	io_lib/abi/seqIOABI.c


8th June 2000, James
--------------------
* RELEASED 1.8.3 */

1. Updated the CTF support so that it includes a couple of new block
types. This allows for base positions being non-sequentially ordered, as is
possible in severe compressions.
	 io_lib/ctf/ctfCompress.c

2. Overhaul of TTFF format - now more PNG based in style. Still highly
experimental.
	io_lib/ttff/*


16th May 2000, James
--------------------
* RELEASED 1.8.0 */

1. Added szip support. Szip generally gives better compression ratios than
gzip and often marginally better than bzip2, but is generally considerably
slower at decompression.
	io_lib/utils/compress.[ch]

2. Merged in Jean Thierre-Mieg's CTF code. This is a compressed trace format
which holds the same data as SCF, but in reduce space.
	io_lib/read/Read.[ch]
	io_lib/utils/traceType.c
	io_lib/ctf/*

3. Added my own highly experimental TTFF format. (Thanks to Jean Thierre-Mieg
for re-awakining my interest in this.) TTFF files are typically equivalent in
size to bzip2'ed SCF files, but are much quicker to write than any of the
currently supported compressed formats. Depends on zlib.
	io_lib/read/Read.[ch]
	io_lib/utils/traceType.c
	io_lib/ttff/*

4. Reorganised the Makefiles for easier building.
	*/Makefile

5. New program "convert_trace". Primarily a test tool at present as it needs
a friendlier interface.
	progs/convert_trace.c


20th April 2000, James
----------------------
1. Removed a file-descriptor leak in extract_seq.
	io_lib/progs/extract_seq.c

22nd March 2000, James
----------------------
1. Fixed bug in time formatting from ABI files. We used strftime code
%a without setting tm.tm_wday (number of days since sunday). It's not
easy to work that out, so we convert from struct tm to time_t, which
resets any errornous elements of struct tm. Also fixed a silly error
where the end time was set to the start time (incorrectly).
	io_lib/abi/seqIOABI.c

25th February 2000, James
-------------------------
2. Added checks for QR <= QL in the exp2read conversion function. This caused
trev to display incorrectly (blanking incorrect screen portions) when dealing
with inconsistent experiment files. Also changed qclip so that it doesn't
create this inconsistent case.
	io_lib/read/translate.c

1st February 2000, Kathryn
--------------------------
1. Fixed bug which caused init_exp to crash when QL was more than 5 digits.
Increased it to handle 15 digits.
	io_lib/read/translate.c

27th January 2000, James
------------------------
1. Moved Gap4's copy of scf_extras into io_lib, and renamed io_liub's
scf_bits to be scf_extras (to avoid editing too many #include statements).
Without this we were getting errors due to dynamic linking using odd
copies. Eg loading libread.so and then libgap.so meant that
find_trace_file called from edUtils2.c (libgap.so) would pick up the first
copy from libread.so, despite the fact that there's also a copy in the
same libgap.so.
	gap4/scf_extras.[ch]
	io_lib/scf_bits.[ch]

25th January 2000, Kathryn
--------------------------
1. Fixed crash in qclip due to insufficent arguments being passed to 
find_trace_file and also fixed an array bounds error in scan_right of qclip.c
	io_lib/read/scf_bits.c
	
19th January 2000, James
------------------------
4. Copied bits of the fakii and cap2/3 scf/expFile reading code into
io_lib. Not all of this is in there, just the things which seem to be
common and sensibly fit there. This also helps qclip to build on Windows.
FIXME: We should now remove some of this code from Gap4.
Also fixed a small memory leak in fopen_compressed() - it wasn't freeing
the result of tempnam().
	io_lib/read/translate.c
	io_lib/read/scf_bits.[ch]
	io_lib/read/seqInfo.[ch]
	io_lib/utils/files.c
	io_lib/utils/compress.c

31st August 1999, James
-----------------------
1. -fasta_out mode of extract_seq now changes - to N.
	io_lib/progs/extract_seq.c

27th August 1999, James
-----------------------
1. The order of information items added by the abi to scf code has
changed, to make it more sensible. Also fixed a bug in the textual (rather
than numerical) date output, and wrote this to the DATE field.
	io_lib/abi/seqIOABI.c

2. makeSCF no longer adds a MACH field, as this was redudant.
	io_lib/abi/makeSCF.c

3. Extract_seq now has proper use of CL and CR when using -cosmid_only. It
was assuming they were the same as QL/QR and SL/SR, which is not the case
(rather it's like having a CS line of `CL`..`CR`). Extract_seq also now
has a -fasta_out format option and can handle multiple files, which makes
it easier to produce a fasta file from multiple experiment files.
	io_lib/progs/extract_seq.c

4th August 1999, James
----------------------
1. The exp2read() function in io_lib now initialises the confidence arrays
(eg r->prob_A) to zero, or to the experiment file AV line.
	io_lib/read/translate.c

2nd June 1999, James
--------------------
1. The MegaBACE sequencer creates ABI files. However it does so in a odd way.
Sometimes the samples arrays are truncated such that bases are positioned
above samples which are not stored in the ABI file. We now realloc the samples
array in such cases and fill out the remainder with blank data. This removes a
crash in trev when viewing such data.
	io_lib/abi/seqIOABI.c

2. Fixed a memory corruption of io-lib compression. The switch to use tempnam
(for Windows) implies that the filename returned is no longer allocated by us.
Unfortunately we forgot to remove the xfree(fname) calls.
	src/io_lib/utils/compress.c

18th May 1999, James
--------------------
1. Fixed the trace rescaling option of makeSCF. We now go through the rescale
function twice. Once to work out the maximum value, and again to do the
rescaling. This fixes a bug where the maximum value after rescaling was
sometimes above 65536 and hence cause "trace wraparound" effects.
	io_lib/progs/makeSCF.c

26th April 1999, JohnT
----------------------
1. Allow : to be entered in RAW_DATA by using ::
	Misc/find.c
	io_lib/utils/find.c

2. Support for fetching trace files using Corba
   Modified:
	Misc/find.c
	mk/misc.mk
	io_lib/utils/find.c
        init_exp/init_exp.c
        io_lib/read/Makefile
        io_lib/utils/find.c
	io_lib/utils/compress.c
	io_lib/utils/Makefile
        mk/global.mk
    Added:
	io_lib/utils/corba.cpp
	io_lib/utils/stcorba.h
    Generated from IDL:
	io_lib/utils/trace.h
	io_lib/utils/trace.cpp
	io_lib/utils/basicServer.h
	io_lib/utils/basicServer.cpp


3. Added ABI utility progs to NT port
	mk/abi.mk

4. Added Windows 95 support
	io_lib/utils/compress.c
        mk/WINNT.mk

5th March 1999, JohnT
---------------------
Various changes for WINNT support as follows:
io_lib/utils       - Don't redirect to /dev/null on WINNT

3rd February 1999, James
------------------------
1. Fixed problems reported by Insure on Windows NT.
These are mainly lack of prototypes (malloc/memcpy) and not returning properly
from 'int' functions. However one fix to seqed_translate.c (find_line_start3)
was a array read overflow.
	io_lib/progs/makeSCF.c

18th January 1999, James
------------------------
1. Changed the read2exp io_lib translation function so that it can accept
lowercase a,c,g,t. Oddly enough it was already coded to accept lowercase IUB
codes, but we missed out a,c,g and t!
	io_lib/read/translate.c

15th January 1999, JohnT
-----------------------
Modified files thoughout for Windows NT Compatibility as follows:

8. need to explicitly set text or binary file mode under WINNT
   io_lib/exp_file/expFileIO.c

18. need to include stddef.h for size_t with Visual C++
    io_lib/utils/array.h

19. need to have target LIBS (not LIB) and correct ordering for correct make
    on WINNT. Also need additional abstractions to allow for different compile
    and link calling conventions with Visual C++, and have rules for building
    Windows .def files.
    io_lib/abi/Makefile
    io_lib/alf/Makefile
    io_lib/exp_file/Makefile
    io_lib/plain/Makefile
    io_lib/progs/Makefile
    io_lib/read/Makefile
    io_lib/scf/Makefile
    io_lib/utils/Makefile

18th December 1998, James
-------------------------
1. Added bzip2 recognition to the (de)compression code of io_lib. This is now
the latest bzip, and is recognised by phred (unlike bzip version 1). Bzip2 is
approx the same as bzip1, but more or less twice as fast for decompression.
	io_lib/utils/compress.c

27th November 1998, James
-------------------------
1. Fixed the trace file searching mechanism in io_lib. When loading an
experiment file with LN/LT lines, we now first search for the trace file
relative to the location of the experiment file.
	io_lib/read/Read.c
	io_lib/read/translate.[ch]

16th November 1998, James
-------------------------
4. Added NT (NoTe) and GD (Gap4 Database) line types to the experiment file.
	io_lib/exp_file/expFile.[ch]

24th September 1998, James
--------------------------
1. The scf reading and writing code now handles traces with zero bases.
Previously this failed after a malloc(0).
	io_lib/scf/read_scf.c
	io_lib/scf/write_scf.c

2. The ABI file reading code has been tidied up. It now also supports
conversion of more ABI fields, including RUND, RUNT, SPAC(2), CMNT, LANE and
MTXF.
	io_lib/abi/seqIOABI.c

17th July 1998, James
---------------------
1. Extract_seq now copes with sequences containing no SQ line (instead of just
SEGV).
	io_lib/progs/extract_seq

9th July 1998, James
--------------------
1. Enforce IUBC code set in io_lib when converting from trace (any format) to
experiment file. We leave the IUBC 'N' intact.
	io_lib/read/translate.c

28th May 1998, James
--------------------
1. Added a read_sections() function to io_lib so that programs can state
which bits of a trace file they are interested in. The loading code only
then parses those bits. This can give big increases to things like init_exp
which only wants bases and does not care about the delta-delta format of SCF
trace data.
	io_lib/read/Read.h
	io_lib/read/translate.c
	io_lib/scf/scf.h
	io_lib/scf/read_scf.c	
	io_lib/abi/seqIOABI.c
	io_lib/alf/seqIOALF.c
	init_exp/init_exp.c

3. Extract GELN (gel name) from ABI file when converting to SCF.
	io_lib/abi/seqIOABI.[ch]

2. Improved the makeSCF -normalise option. Background subtraction is now
cleaner (and simpler) and it also now scales the heights. Moved it to io_lib
as it's now freely available.
	io_lib/progs/makeSCF.c

23rd March 1998, James
----------------------
1. Removed the change made on 7th May 1997 to seqIOPlain.c. This code is used
by extract_seq, and so clipping in seqIOPlain causes double clipping (and
hence wrong sections).
	io_lib/plain/seqIOPlain.c

11th March 1998, James
----------------------
2. Removed the requirement of EXP_FILE_LINE_LENGTH in exp_fread_info().
This allows for (eg) tags with very long comments to be read in without
being truncated.
	io_lib/exp_file/expFileIO.c

4th March 1998, James
---------------------
1. Following advice from Leif Hansson <leif.hansson@mbox4.swipnet.se>, the ALF
reading code now reads the "Raw data" subfile when the "Processed data"
subfile is not present, as "Processed data" is apparently an optional output
of the pharmacia software. Raw data is in the same format, although I do not
know what processing takes place to convert it to Processed data. (Looking at
some real traces, apparently none!)
	io_lib/alf/seqIOALF.c

24th February 1998, James
-------------------------
1. Added an ABI in MacBinary format file type detector so that these are
now autodetected.
	io_lib/utils/traceType.c

15th January 1998, James
------------------------
1. Rewrote the delta_samples1/2 functions to be faster. Times vary between 0.55
and 0.7 fractions of the original time.
	io_lib/scf/misc_scf.c

4th December 1997, James
------------------------
1. First post-release bug fix.
Io_lib incorrect sets read->trace_name when reading anything except SCF files.
This means that when outputting to an experiment file no LN line is present.
	io_lib/read/Read.c

1st October 1997, James
-----------------------
1. Allow for SCF files to contain 0 bases. This mainly affects memory
allocation, but also the display widget.
	io_lib/scf/read_scf.c
	io_lib/utils/read_alloc.c

28/29th August 1997, James
--------------------------
2. Added a few changes to make the code more portable for the Mac. Not really
used at present.
	Misc/os.h
	Misc/files.c
	io_lib/utils/traceType.c
	io_lib/read/translate.c
	io_lib/utils/compress.c

30th June 1997, James
---------------------
1. The exp2read function produced invalid rightCutoff values (INT_MAX) when no
QR line is present. It now correctly sets it to 0.
	io_lib/read/translate.c
