Use renamed tmpfile_win on Windows for all compilers rather than just
MSC.  This fixes issue with more recent linux to windows
cross-compilers and there is no benefit to having the function named
tmpfile anyway.

Improvements to endianness detection.

We now use the os.h SP_?_ENDIAN macros, which in turn are set using
autoconf and/or auto-detected via a bunch of ifdefs (incase we ever
need to run on a platform that autoconf doesn't support).

cram_size.

Added a faster (than Zlib) crc32 implementation; under either BSD or
Zlib license - it's unclear which, but both are compatible.

There is also a configure option to disable this local code.  This is
useful when linking against CloudFlare's optimised Zlib implementation
as this has a still faster CRC if the PCLMUL instruction is available.

The fix in r3942 for small stack sizes on pthread/MacOS X changed use
of stack to heap.  This caused about 4% slow down, so it is now a
#define.

Also adding further tweaks to the rANS implementation designed to
speed up the code on modern processors, mainly through better
instruction ordering.

Huge cull of the cram_stats_encoding function.

It used to determine huffman vs beta vs external based on a variety of
techniques, but not it's brutally simple:  1 unique symbol implies
huffman, everything else implies external.

The reason is to avoid ever mixing different data series together, to
permit better random access, which in turn means never using the CORE
block.  Hence beta, subexp, gamma, and most huffman are no longer
suitable choices.

Removed defunct next_content_id variable.

This was a temporary part of the tag splitting code that was rewritten
and become unnecessary.

   M /io_lib/trunk/progs/scramble.c

Added experimental -p & -P options to scramble.

These preserve the order of auxiliary tags, but forcibly encoding RG,
MD and NM tags instead of auto-generating them,  and prevent size
reduction of overly large auxiliary tags.  This is where we have, say,
an MC:i:32 SAM record encoded as an MCi<20><00><00><00> BAM record
instead of the smaller MCc<20> encoding.

There is little benefit to using these options unless you really want
your CRAM file to change as little as possible when converting back to
BAM.  Note, storing RG, MD and NM still won't preserve order for the
Java cram world as the order of tags is exported in some internal
hash-table order.

   M /io_lib/trunk/io_lib/cram_structs.h

Fixes index query for references with no hits (htslib d7541514).

This didn't actually affect io_lib as the seek function operates
differently and returns a different error code, but the additional
check does not harm and brings the implementations into alignment
again.

Also fixed cram_fd->record_counter to be 64-bit; an omission in the
recent commits.

   M /io_lib/trunk/io_lib/cram_structs.h

Merging in changes from htslib.

Resolved buffer overrun when last sequence is "*".

Better freeing of memory on errors.

Improved required_fields handling; CRAM_QUAL is no longer decoded when
asking for CRAM_SEQ.

Reduced memory usage for decodes, partly by dynamically growing the
array by a smaller amount and partly by an improved estimation of the
initial array sizes.

Minor formatting / commenting tweaks to make spotting differences
easier.

   M /io_lib/trunk/io_lib/cram_codecs.h
   M /io_lib/trunk/io_lib/cram_io.h

Brought cram_codecs in line with htslib changes.

- codec2str() removed; it was dup of cram_encoding2str().
- Made beta codec more robust with out of bounds value (num items < 0).
- More consistent val vs value (always use "val" given we have "len" too).
- Revised cram_not_enough_bits function

Lots of small tweaks pulled in from htslib.

- Formatting corrections.
- Improved AP_delta / pos_sorted usage, fixing decoder -> encoder
  switching (htslib/e399970f7eac5abb2fc95331e6a2c5a3ba60e4c7)
- Improvements in shutting down after a cram_compress_slice failure.
  (htslib/ad3c4c5633fce4613cca4295ce25801694a298cf).
- Various other minor things (errno, order of checks, etc).

Added a safe_ltf8_decode function to go along with the itf8 variant.

Switched the record_counter from 32-bit to 64-bit.  This is as per the
spec, but it was an error that we only stored it in 32-bit.

(Plus a couple tiny minor tweaks to spacing, to make diffing to htslib
easier.)

Applied htslib 97a79332d2f8089507b9f32aa31d5b95e72fad00

    Bug fix to refs_from_header().
    
    The patch to hts_set_fai_filename() caused a new failure mode in this
    function. If given a .fai file with sequence records that are not in
    the same order as the @SQ lines in a SAM header, the code to parse the
    @SQ header and potentially add new records that aren't in the original
    .fai file was failing, returning -1.
    
    We now do a better job of merging the references together.

Added some hand-crafted BAMs to exercise the latest change to
cram_encode.c (improved shrinkage of BAM aux sizes).

This also needed a modification to the test environment so it could
input BAM as well as SAM; potentially a useful extension for the
future.

Fixed a bug in the CRAM encoding of BAM aux data.
A 16-bit integer value that could be fitted into an 8-bit unsigned
quantity caused an invalid aux block.  Thanks to Joe Rayner for
spotting this.  (It hasn't been observed in the wild; likely nothing is
producing BAMs of this nature.)

In fixing this I also added code to shrink signed values where
possible too.

   M /io_lib/trunk/io_lib/bam.h

Removed the setvbuf code as it was harming piping and pretty much
having nil effect on file based I/O.  scramble | wc -c was up to 50%
slower due to the larger vbuf.  We're best to let fopen just work it
out.

Also changed the BGZF_BUFF_SIZE parameter.  This is the maximum size
of uncompressed data to guarantee that the compressed data will still
fit under a 64K block, thus being indexable in bgzf via its 16-bit
size field.  This works out at 65477, dropped to 65400 for safety.

However recent data shows that 65273 is up to 30% faster at encoding
when using compression level 0.  If the input buffer gets within
MIN_LOOKAHEAD of the end then zlib calls fill_window(), shuffling
things down a bit to make room.  65535 - MIN_LOOKAHEAD is 65273, thus
we guarantee to not trigger this function overhead.

Added a lossy read-name method to scramble (-n).

This takes care to handle supplementary reads too and also uses the TC
aux field if present (it almost never is!).

Note, using scramble to convert a lossy read-name CRAM to a new CRAM
will increase the size as it doesn't currently remember the lossy
mode.  This is either a feature or a bug, depending on use.

Ie scramble -N 10000 in.cram out.cram

This triggered a bug where the decoding cram pool was flushed during
closing, attempting to write a container (to a file descriptor opened
for read, leading to crashes due to missing buffers).

Also improved the CRAM_IO_CUSTOM_BUFFERING checks so it builds again
without being defined.

   M /io_lib/trunk/io_lib/bam.h

Horrid temporary hack to avoid exporting append_int/append_uint if it
looks like we're including this file from within gap5.

It's simply a way to avoid a type clash with the same function name in
gap5 and io_lib, but with different signedness prototypes.  Previously
the current tarball of Staden Package doesn't compile cleanly against
the newer tarballs of io_lib.  The ideal solution is to release a
fixed Staden Package too that uses the newly added io_lib function,
but that comes later.

Cram_size now accurately determines the content_ids used by a codec,
rather than just assuming it is the last byte in the codec meta-data.

This means it works correctly for the newer tag ids and for
cramtools.jar output.

   M /io_lib/trunk/io_lib/cram_structs.h

Use a derived content_id for aux tags based on the 3 character tag
code:type.  (This was already the way that the java Cramtools.jar
worked.)

The benefit is that we no longer need to maintain a fd-global counter
of unique tag types seen so far, which in turn fixes problems in the
biobambam interface.

Made cram_flush call cram_update_curr_slice too so that the s->hdr
field is correctly filled out.

This function isn't normally called explicitly (as cram_close performs
its own flush), but it is from within the biobambam work-package
interface.  (Fixes a bug reported by German Tischler triggered by
libmaus2's testparallelbamblocksort.)

Disable the per-slice md5 creation and checks (SD and BD slice tags).

Behaviour of these have changed in a recent Java Cramtools release,
indicating that we shouldn't be using these until they are formally
added to the specification as they are too fluid currently.

For future work, once CRAM version 3.1 exists with the tags defined
we'll need to only check these tags if the CRAM version is 3.1 and
above as we have generated several v3.0 CRAM files with differing
BD/SD endianness.

We now admit that -Z and -! exist (although -! should be used very
sparingly).

Updated the text to remove a zlib-only bias and clarified that -j and
-Z aren't a wholesale switch of compression method, but rather adding
in additional methods to select from if beneficial.

More importantly it now copes with nul characters on the end of the
header where they are also included in the length of the header.

   M /io_lib/trunk/io_lib/cram_io.c

Fixed a potential crash bug where we attempt to compress a block that
previously failed to compress (the compressed size was larger then the
uncompressed one) using a cram_metric structure off the end of the
fixed size metrics array.

Fixed, in two different places for belt and braces, a bug where the
try-and-cache strategy of cram_metrics was not working for the newly
split auxiliary tag blocks.  This means it was slower than desired,
considerably so if we mix in more (and slower) methods with scramble
-j -Z.  File sizes are almost identical.

   A /io_lib/trunk/progs/cram_size.c

This is equivalent to the final table output by cram_dump, but an
order of magnitude faster as it doesn't need to uncompress anything.

Fixed bugs causing scram_flagstat -t2 to crash.

On error, we shouldn't do t_pool_flush and cram_flush_result as the
data structures may not have been initialised in all threads
(particularly one generating an error).

The second issue is the error itself.  This was due to additional
error checking in r3916 to check unmapped reads have no alignment
position.  It's not a valid check when we are not decode CRAM_AP data
series.

Improved zlib compression methods again.

Observed that the reason why Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY wins over Z_FILTERED
for our mc:i:<num> (mate coordinate) tag unlike all other zlib uses is
not so much the strategy as the impact is has on how hard it tries.
Using compression level 1 has both a better effect (it's smaller still
on mc:i: block) while being considerably faster.

So changed the default method back to Z_FILTERED and GZIP_FLT codec is
now GZIP_1 (default strategy at level 1).

Minor tweaks.

Use both Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY and Z_FILTERED only on compression level 6
and above as it's 6-7% more cpu and rarely makes much difference
except on specific data sets.

Also noticed and fixed a cram version 2.1 vs 3.0 difference that
wasn't correctly honoured - the container record counter is 64-bit, so
we need to allow for this.  (In practice it wouldn't make a difference
until we got to > 2 billion records.)

Misc updates to improve compression ratios.  The major change here was
to split auxiliary tags into their own blocks, but several smaller
optimisations took place at the same time.

- Changed the default GZIP strategy to Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY and added a
  separate GZIP_FLT method, much like GZIP_RLE works.

  This is because I found some cases where the default strategy was
  far superior (and vice versa).

- cram_compress_block no longer keeps blocks which grew during
  compression.

- cram_get_block_by_id returns are now cached, removing a lot of time
  spend linear scanning.

- Aux tags are now strictly one tag KeyKey:Type per block.  This
  simplified all the existing code to explicitly handle OQ, FZ, BQ,
  etc blocks, but made other areas more complex.

  Specifically we now have an unknown number of blocks to deal with.
  This means that the cram_metrics, holding the compression method
  performance per block type, now has to be allocated on-the-fly for
  each tag code witnessed along with code to generate new block
  content_ids.  These are new fields in the cram_fd struct
  (fd->tags_used and fd->next_content_id).

  Aux tags now auto-resize to their smallest data size.  This is
  because we routinely see things like MQ:i:10 encoded as "i" in BAM
  with 3 out of 4 values being 0.  I am unsure of which tool causes
  this to happen.

- Dropped version 1 cram support in some places.
  TODO: go through the rest of the code dropping it too.  It's dead
  and was never really an officially recognised format (in that the
  implemented code by Java nor C did not match the specification in
  numerous places).

Fixed bug with non-reference base CRAMs and indexing.

When using --output-fmt cram,no_ref the reference sequence is not
loaded into memory, causing the "ref_end" container field to be unset.
This in turn meant that the code that clipped the container header
start/end fields (pos+span) to the actual reference length, to work
around buggy aligners that positiong data off the end of the
reference, was itself buggy.

Change rANS O1 codecs to allocate large arrays on the heap.

rans_compress_O1 needed about 1.25 Mb of stack for a couple of 256x256
arrays.  This caused problems on MacOS X when running in threaded mode
due to running out of per-thread stack.  The default stack size for
threads on MacOS X is 512 K.  For details, see:
https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/qa/qa1419/_index.html

This changes rans_compress_O1 and rans_uncompress_O1 to use malloc
and calloc to allocate the arrays instead of using the stack.

Fix CRAM_IO_CUSTOM_BUFFERING error checking on write

cram_io_flush_output_buffer and cram_io_output_buffer_write were trying to
detect errors by looking for unsigned fwrite-like function return values < 0,
which can't happen (bug spotted by clang warning).  This fixes the checks
to look for a return value indicating fewer items than requested were
written, which is how fwrite reports errors.  The error handling code
is also adjusted slightly so that the cram_fd_output_buffer is as far as
possible in a consistent state after a short write.

cram_mem_write_callback in cram_bambam.c gets updated to correctly follow
fwrite's interface.  It was returning (size_t) -1 on error. Now it returns
nmemb on success and 0 on error as it either writes everything or nothing.

Also remove a stray while (0) from cram_io_open.

Revision 3664 fixed a problem where some external blocks were not being

comparing the block cram_content_type with values from cram_encoding, which
is not valid.  The real solution to the problem was elsewhere in revision
3664, so this patch removes the incorrect comparisons.  They were harmless

Fix compiler warnings from gcc -Wall

Mainly unused variables, unhandled enumerated types in case statements
and signed/unsigned pointers.

bam_set_bin() in io_lib/bam.h becomes a static inline function.  The
BAM flags definitions in the same file also had to move so that BAM_CIGAR32
is defined before bam_set_bin().

The static arrays defined in binning.h get moved into a new file binning.c
and linkage changed to extern.

Changes to cram library functions have as far as possible been made so that
they match the versions in htslib.

Improved error handling with corrupt files.

This is related to the recent htslib change, however done differently
here.

The calling API for scram_get_seq returns -1 for failure to read, but
the caller then has to check cram_eof to determine if that is due to
EOF or not.  The problem is if we deliberately only decode some and
not all then we're not at EOF.

Rather than specifically require the caller to track all this, we now
make cram_eof return -1 if an error has been detected. (In htslib this
is done by making sam_read1 return -2 instead.  Possibly we could do
the same here as well.)

Better tests for bit-based codecs running out of input.

"american fuzzy lop" found a case where the checks for running out of
input added in #3895 failed.  This happened due to the result of
in->uncomp_size - in->byte being unsigned rather than signed, so the check
failed when in->byte was greater than in->uncomp_size.

The checks are pulled into a new static inline cram_not_enough_bits.  This
has been checked with frama_c to work as long as:
   0 <= blk->bit < 8
   0 <= blk->uncomp_size
   blk->uncomp_size, blk->bit and nbits are of type int32_t
   blk->byte is of type size_t

Instances of the old code are replaced with cram_not_enough_bits.

get_one_bits_MSB gets the same checks for running out of input as are already
in get_zero_bits_MSB.

cram_subexp_decode_init gets a check to ensure subexp.k >= 0 and
cram_subexp_decode checks for i >= 0.

Bug fix to the CRC32 checking for Java/C integration.

The block and container header CRCs check sum variable sized data.
The old method was to decode the structure and then reencode to a
block of memory that we can compute the CRC on.  Unfortunately there
is more than one valid encoding for the same numerical integer value,
and even more unfortunately Java and C implementations differ.  This
gives rise to false CRC failures.

The new code computes the CRC as it goes using the actual bytes being
decoded.  This isn't as quick, but the measured difference in speed is
under 1%.

Fixed the broken "special case" in index querying.

The binary search due to the comparisons may yield a value 1 bin too
low when the position asked for precisely matches the start coordinate
of an index bin. The intention of the special case is to correct this,
but it did so without checking whether the current bin returned
actually did overlap the requested range too.

This therefore lead to starting to decode too late into the file,
giving fewer overlapping sequences than desired.

attempt to extract -1 bytes.

Also fixed NM and MD handling for sequence "*".  In this case we cannot
derive it as we have nothing to compare against, so we store any

Protection against various CIGAR/seq issues.

1) During encoding, if the cigar string is too long or too short for
the sequence then we produce an error and bail out.

2) During decoding, if the cigar string maps off the end of the
sequence and our sequence was "*" then we now have better bounds
checking when copying from the reference sequence.

Check for the @HD SO:sort-order field, with new parse function in

We now use this when setting fd->unsorted so that a packed slice with
multiple references in it is not always considered unsorted.  If the
file claims to be sorted then it'll incr/decr refs internal to the
slice as it progresses.

This avoids an issue with high memory usage on very small files where
all data is packed into one slice.  Previously it remembered all
references used as it assumed they'd be reused again very soon
(unsorted mode).

Improved the CRAM stats array usage.

Read-pair detection during encoding now has a saner view, with
better commenting, of the hoops to go through to keep the cram_stats
arrays up to date.  A few bugs were detected here, potentially leading
to suboptimal Huffman trees, by instrumenting the ->encode() calls
and comparing them to cram_dump_stats() outputs.

Passes tests, real world data files and struggled to find manually
constructed torture cases that cause it to fail.  It's still hairy and
complex though!

Overhauled the pnext/tlen/flags for detached reads.

Now when we find a second (or more) copy of a read within a slice, we
do not automatically mark is as non-detached.  We check whether the
derived fields match those found in the file and if not we emit a
"detached" read causing these fields to be written verbatim.  We also
do this if the data is supplementary, as the meaning of that flag is
poorly defined.

This is particularly useful on bwa-mem output where there is currently
a disparity between bwa and io_lib on the interpretation of
supplementary/primary.

Overhauled the cram_dependent_data_series function and associated
code.

Previously it contained

    if (hdr->data_series & CRAM_SEQ) hdr->data_series |= CRAM_CIGAR

but this is too permissive as it means even something like CRAM_BF (in
the CRAM_SEQ expansion) would cause all over members of CRAM_SEQ to be
brought in when they are not strictly needed by the code path.

Instead these have been replaced by more explicit dependencies,
analysed from the source code. This has been tested by producing
CRAM files with random mixing of data series and then explicitly
requesting single columns vs all columns to compare the results.

In doing so found and fixed a few other long standing data-series bugs
too, such as a dependence on CRAM_BF for more fields that it would
appear obviously necessary.

Tidied up the CRAM randomiser code. This was originally some #if 0-ed
out code to mix data series together in random manners. Somewhere
along the ling it broke.

The new code (unused unless RANDOMISER is defined) is simpler, using
solely the CORE huffman block as a means to mix data series together.
This is still sufficient mixing to test the dependent_data_series
functions.

Reverted the cram_encode_container change to call cram_ref_incr and
added a ref incr in cram_get_ref instead. This better fixes the issue
of sharing references between containers, fixing decoding as well as
encoding.

Also prevented encoding from creating c->refs_used when multi_seq

Fixed a logic error in the cram_ref_decr_locked function. It shouldn't
set r->last_id to -1 ever, as with containers large enough to fit the
entire reference this caused it to end up alternating between free and
non-free of reference.

The set of -1 in cram_ref_incr_locked was already sufficient to
prevent repeated incr#1/decr#1/incr#1/decr#1 from freeing and reloading.

cram_encode_container for multi-ref containers pre-caches all the
references in memory, and then decrements the ref count at the end to
(potentially) free them again.  Unfortunately it didn't do an explicit
cram_ref_incr at the start meaning it caused the refs to be
repopulated for each and every container rather than honouring the
fd->shared_ref variable.

Added in the compressed length field to the rANS codec header.

Technically this isn't needed, but it adds a very small extra amount
of space and it allows for the internal rANS codec to be the same

codec internally to compress very large buffers using a smaller block
size.

This now brings this code into line with the Java cramtools

Improvements to the search path code.

1) Elements of |http and |ftp no longer cause it to fail the : vs ::

2) Removed the valid variable and checks. Instead it is done with a
far simpler break statement at the end of the loop to bail out if we
requested it via "|ele".

3) Force http:// queries to only check once, regardless of whether it
is preceeded by |.  This is because data-compression is better handled

Replaced RANS0 and RANS1 codec identifiers with a single RANS
codec.  Internally we still call them RANS0 and RANS1 methods so it
can auto-tune to order-0 or order-1 in the statistics, but before
writing out we force both to be RANS/RANS0 identifier.

The rANS implementation has therefore added an extra byte (order) to
the data stream.  I also tweaked the efficiency of decoding a bit more
so it's now faster.

A mishmash of changes for CRAM v3.0 (not yet the default output
format). Sorry it's munged together.

The 'b' and 'q' feature types have been implemented, allowing multiple
bases and qualities to be stored as a single feature. This greatly
speeds up scramble -x mode (referenceless) while also reducing the
file size.

Added support for the BYTE_ARRAY_LEN encoder. It already existed in
decoder, but it is optimal for some cases to use as encoder instead of
the usual BYTE_ARRAY_STOP.

Bug fix to the external decoders. If there is an attempt to decode 0
bytes then it no longer matters if the block does not exist. (This
comes about when faced with silly CIGAR strings like "0S".) Changed
scramble to no longer output empty blocks.

Cram_dump: this now outputs the compression types used for each
external block as g(gzip), b(bzip2), l(lzma), r(rANS0) and R(rANS1).

Modified the thread pool to use as few threads as possible. The
intention is that when given, say, 16 threads but being I/O bound such
that 12 cores is enough to keep up with the I/O then we have 12
threads kept busy and 4 totally idle.

This is implemented by dispatching jobs on lower thread IDs in
preference and maintaining a queue of pending jobs in proportion to
the number of threads currently running, rather than instantly
dispatching.

Fixed EOF to be set to 1 (expected EOF) on first opening a file and
then changed to 0 (error) before decoding each container+slice.
Previously it started as 0.

The effect of this is that when asking for only the header and not
decoding a single read, we no longer incorrectly claim an unexpected
EOF.

Merged in the cram_refactor branch.

This consists of a major overhaul of the way cram data series are
managed.

- The C structs are now more array based, preferring ->block[DS_XX]
  instead of ->XX_blk and similar. 

- Many more block types wil be external by default now. It
  auto-selects CORE vs external based on size.

- Selection of compression algorithm for external blocks is more
  advanced.  Every external block has a metrics array element. This
  now tracks more than 2 types of compression and it culls candidate
  methods if they repeatedly are unpromising.

  The upshot is the hard-coded selection of which method to use for
  which block is (mostly) removed in favour of auto detection.

- CRAM now has the option to ignore certain types of fields when
  decoding.  Combined with more external blocks this permits faster
  decoding for tools like scram_flagstat, potentially 2-3x faster.

- Auxiliary tags now get split up into multiple external blocks based
  on data type. We still aggregate many together, but tag strings,
  integers, sequences and quality strings now get their own blocks.

Bug in the EOF block writing code. It was outputting

Added a range coder (order 0 and 1, but only the order-1 coder is used
at the moment, and probably Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY is good enough for most
scenarios to replace an order-0 RC).

This can be enabled using scramble -J, although note it produces
non-standard CRAM files so should be considered as an experimental
option. It is likely that the output format may change still, so use
for testing only.

Also updated how the encoding selection methods work. Scramble -j (for
bzip2) no longer attempts to bzip2 everything. Instead it tests bz2 vs
zlib on a few trials and selects whichever is best. This means -j and
-J indicate additional codecs, but not mandate their use for
everything.  Best encoding so far comes from scramble -jJ therefore.

There is also an interface to LZMA (xz) compression, but currently it
is not enabled and has been used experimentally only.

Finally, also sped up the CRAM->BAM in memory struct conversion by
translating 2 sequence characters at a time.

Bug fix to the EOF handling and also a simplification.

We incorrectly reported the lack of an EOF block when checking a
sub-range, where we get an expected EOF at the end of range but this
isn't due to a file EOF.

Simplifying this the API now uses scram_eof() returning 0 for false, 1
for expected eof and 2 for unexpected eof (no EOF block).

Bug fix to EOF block writing in multi-threaded mode. It was writing it
out before flushing the final pending blocks, causing EOF block to
sometimes appear slightly before the true end of file.

Added an EOF block to CRAM which simply consists of a container
containing no sequences and a special ref-seq-position field.  In
theory this is backwards compatible, but in practice was not due to
bugs (in both C and Java implementations).

Also added checking of the EOF blocks for BAM too.

Added missing return code checks.  Fixed 'x' mode of mfreopen.

Added missing checks for system call return codes.  Mainly malloc/realloc
but also i/o calls in mfflush.

Removed pointless check to see if the underlying file is seekable in
mfreopen when 'x' is present in the mode string.  The whole point of 'x'
was to turn off a seek in mfflush, so it doesn't matter if the file is
seekable or not.

Add mfsteal to mFILE, and use it in cram_populate_ref.

mfsteal returns the data stored in an mFILE.  The mFILE itself is closed
after the data has been detached.  This can be used to replace an
unnecessary allocation and copy if the entire contents of the mFILE are
wanted.

Update cram_populate_ref to use mfsteal.  This halves the memory it uses
when trying to load via REF_PATH.

Fixed a bunch of code warnings produced by clang's static analyser.

1) Various memory leaks, all caused by returning after a malloc
failure without freeing precursor allocations.

2) Fixed potential error in cram_codecs.c where an external block ID
could fail to be found, resulting in dereferencing a null pointer.

3) Improved guards around block IDs to prevent negative blocks (not
found by clang).

4) Removal of dead code; assignments that are no longer used.

Added GRL copyright too due to appropriate local requirements.

Sorry that occasionally it will have been automatically added for the
most mundance of micro-changes (like adjustments to comments or
changing #include <x> to #include "x"). However given the licence is
BSD and do-what-you-like it is compatible with the MRC one.

Purged CTF from the source tree.

It had no explicitly stated licence (although was implicitly assumed
to be given to us under the same licence as the rest of the code,
this is not technically enough).

Obviously we could have got this corrected, but the code is also
superfluous (I never saw a CTF file in the wild) and we remove a large
number of compilation warnings too.

Added the 3-clause BSD copyright notices as issued by MRC-LMB when they
made the entire package open source (which included this).

Where possible the dates and authors are correct. They have been
culled from semi-automatic analysis of the old MRC change.log file,
but some files predate keeping these logs. Apologies to absent
authors.

(Next up, GRL/Sanger copyright notices.)

thread safe (it potentially uses open_path_url+curl in a manner which
shares the curl handle between threads).

Secondly certain thread orderings could cause the reference count to
hit zero and then try to reaccess it again, which triggered a
bug. ref->length is now reset to zero as well as ->seq=NULL as both
are checked.

Optimised the compression levels so -1, -3, and above are more
distinct and use their own specific zlib parameters.

Minor speed up.

includes an API to do arithmetic compression (implementation not
checked in as it's unused now) and an example of how to do
string-delta encoding for read names.

Improved error reporting and detection for MD5 sums. We report where
the md5 error comes from (which reference slice). We also have better
detection of slices that overhang the end of the reference.

Finally it no longer crashes sometimes after getting reference errors,
now exiting cleanly with exit code 1.

Back port from minor tweaks at github's jkbonfield/samtools. This
change adds SAMTOOLS macros for bam_copy and bam_dup, and tweaks the
pthreads interface to accept an NTHREADs option, allowing the cram_fd
to own the pool instead of the caller. (This isn't the best solution
for samtools, but pragmatic.)

to compile without pthreads (I haven't tested anything under Windows

Fixed a cram->cram encoding race condition caused by zeroing the
reference before doing close (or specifically, a flush).

The scram_set_refs(out, NULL) is no longer needed anyway now as the
refs struct is reference-counted and so can be freed by both in and
out file handles without causing bugs.

Speed up of sam_next_seq(). It's about 70% faster (70% more
throughput, not 70% less time taken) now. This also means it's around
4x quicker than the samtools equivalent function.

This is largely through processing strings one word at a time instead
of byte by byte.

Added reference counting to headers. This means we can avoid clumsy
code in scramble.c to set header to NULL before closing (to avoid
double frees).

Improved support for file type detection. Now that BAM/SAM uses stdio
we use getc/ungetc to query the first character, allowing file type
detection on stdin.

Improved the ambiguous TLEN case where both start and end are at the
same point.

Ie

-----------> first
-----------> last

or

-----------> first
<----------- last

It's valid at this stage to set both to be +ve as technically each is
both the leftmost and rightmost. However we now disambiguate this case
by the first/last bit flags instead.

Simplify the cram_decode_slice_xref code given we now know it's
executed on each and every sequence in the slice before attempting to
convert to BAM. This means we don't have to fix up mate information,
only our own information.

one other) introduced during the move to cram_decode_slice_xref().

Bug fixes to cram index handling.

1) The binary search found *a* slice containing the requested range,
but it wasn't guaranteed to be the first slice. Consequentially we
sometimes missed some reads.

2) Fixed a crash where repeated calls to cram_seek_to_refpos could
reuse freed containers.

Also improved documentation after scratching my head at the code,
forgetting it was based around a nested containment list.

Bug fix for range queries of unmapped reads. We now set the end
coordinate to be the start coordinate instead of -1.

Also moved the slice cross-reference resolving code from cram_to_bam
to a sub-function called by cram_decode_slice itself. This means that
we can resolve cross-references for reads partially used in a range
query. (Previously a fetching back a sub-range would leave mate_flags
uninitialised.)

1) Various gcc -Wall fixes; mostly type-punning now resolved by
unions.

2) Potential bug fix to scram_merge demo program when using multiple
refs. (On 32-bit systems only?)

3) Added .mft1.00 to the magic number search for 454 indexed SFF
files, in addition tot he old .srt1.00 string. The two seem
compatible.

4) Improved cram_to_bam() handling of aux fields. It identifies the
aux location via bam_aux() now instead of assuming it's part of the
same bam struct. This has no effect for io_lib, but makes the code
work within Samtools.

5) "make check" now runs under a debugging environment if $VALGRIND is
set in the environment. Eg VALGRIND="valgrind --db-attach=yes" make check

It was included in the CRAM 1.0 spec but removed from 2.0. I added it
to investigate how well it performs. Conclusion: 5-10% space

but something like twice as slow. I don't think it's worth the
overhead and long-term we should go to modelling + arithmetic coding
to get better time/size tradeoffs.

Changed interface to bam_construct_seq, to make it easier to use.

bam_construct_seq now takes a bam_seq_t **, so it can resize the structure
if it is not big enough.  It also calulates the size needed itself, so
there is no need for the caller to work out how much space is needed.  The
caller can reserve space for auxiliary tags with the extra_len parameter,
though.  The start parameter has been removed, as it should always be the
same as pos.  Some data types have changed to more suitable choices (e.g.
ncigar is now unsigned, arrays and strings have const qualifiers).

Added some sanity checking to bam_construct_seq inputs.  Fixed bug with
handling of qual == NULL.  It now sets the quality values to 0xff.

Improved bam_construct_seq documentation by  adding @param lines.

Updated cram_to_bam to use the new bam_construct_seq interface.

Fixed too-late check for b == NULL in bam_close.

  /tmp/.cram_cache/XX/XX/XXXXXXXXXXXX.

  fastas if appropriate and the .fai are not loaded up until we
  require them.

Experimental caching and web accesses for reference server.

Set REF_PATH to be a colon separated directory of places to check.
These are accessed in the same way that TRACE_PATH / RAWDATA environ
is for trace files.

Set REF_CACHE to a globally writeable location you wish to write data
back to, to form a local cache.

For URL within REF_PATH %s is replaced by the MD5 string. Eg:

export REF_PATH=/tmp/.cram_cache:URL=http:://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/cram/md5/%s

Many bug fixes for big-endian systems.

Also improved the handling of systems not supporting unaligned word
access. It could be improved further via autoconf, but for now it's
only enabled on x86 platforms via os.h.

Fixed bam behaviour when ALLOW_UAC is undefined.
Also (untested) fixed some big-endian issues. Need to experiment with
proper systems.

Changed the bam structure to have explicit flag, bin, map_qual,
cigar_len and flags instead of manually bit-packing into two
int32s. This is similar speed (if not slower), but was changed to
allow better compatibility with samtools API.

Added cram_stats.h to Makefile.am

Fixed decoding of the substitution matrix. There are two variants of
this too due to compatibility with the Java code which uses ordering
ACGNT instead of ACGTN as documented in the spec. (The correct version
is the one used.)

Added an undocumented option to ignore MD5 checksum errors. Useful for
debugging at times, but not to be recommended.

Bug fix when encoding with ref_id -1 (unmapped data). Our error
checking for unavailable reference was triggering incorrectly.

Also no longer decode RI data series for slices with only one
reference as this is how the Java 2.0 code is working. I'm not sure
which spec interpretation makes the most sense yet.

Fix for bam_next_seq returning 1, 0 or -1 instead of 0 or -1.

We need to unify the calling semantics between sam, bam and cram
here. Maybe 0 vs -1 and create an scram_eof() method to distinguish
between -1 being failure vs eof?

Added scram_*() functions to act as an interface to sam/bam or cram
I/O functions.

Used these to implement scramble (aka sCRAMble), a replacement for
sam_convert, sam_to_cram and cram_to sam. It can be used as an
conversion from any of sam/bam/cram to sam/bam/cram.

Added a -X option to use embedded references.

When encoding, this stores reference portions per slice.

When decoding, this specifies the lack of a reference on the command
line or header is no longer an error. It also uses the embedded
reference in preference to any it finds via other means. (Note it is
legal to have a file where some portions have embedded references and
some do not.)

Removed SM from the preservation map for 1.0 output. While legal in
the 1.0 spec, the Java cramtools didn't implement it so it causes
compatibility issues.

Also fixed some more hard coded block content IDs, replacing them with
#define symbols.

Finally, added some more rigorous memory allocation error checking.

Added support for reading and writing the @SQ UR field to specify the
reference location. This means that "-r ref.fa" is now genuingly an
optional command line argument.

TODO: fix the mess of sam_header.c string handling. It should use
pooled strings (Misc/string_alloc_t from Staden Pkg) instead and store
actual string pointers. This will be memory and cache efficient while
still giving a more natural interface.

Updated the program argument syntax.

The reference is now optional and specified via -r.
This will allow for future work to be fitted in easier; allowing
referenceless compression (eg unsorted data we may not want to bother
doing reference based encoding) and allowing for auto-detection of
reference based on SAM/CRAM headers.

Moved the SAM header manipulation out of the BAM structure and into
its own struct (SAM_hdr). This means it can then be used from within
CRAM without having to add a fake zero-record BAM file into the cram
structs.

Also expanded this greatly with the addition of full header parsing
and manipulation, including tracking of multiple @PG chains.

Improved cram_to_sam -r option for specifying a sequence range. This
is now parsed as name:start-end rather than numericId:start-end.

Changed CF and MF codecs to read/write integers instead of bytes for
1.1.

Updated the CRAM support to the proposed version 1.1 (or is it 2.0?).

I still need to implement unsorted data and the indexing format needs
fixing too, although this has been dropped from the spec for now.

New features:
- MD5 strings per slice so we can quickly detect reference issues when
  doing random access.

- SAM header is now in a block in its own container.

- Record count and number of bases are stored in the container header,
  to allow quick "cram stats" analysis (tool not written yet).

- Auxiliary fields (aka tags) are stored with TL/TD instead of TN/TC;
  a dictionary and line within that dict.

- Updates for itf8 vs int32 in various places.

- BAM flags have been swapped around to matych BAM.

- cram_(en/de)code.c for in-memory packing and unpacking of CRAM data

- cram_codecs.c for the encoders: huffman, beta, gamma, external etc.

Corrected the storage of ambiguity bases. When encoding N vs R we were

This meant reordering things a bit, but I've verified I can decode it

Correctly handle ambiguity codes in the reference (eg R) - we treat
them as N for base codes, but compare against the upper case version
when creating features so we can match against them.

Also handle ambiguity codes in sequence (where they mismatch the
reference). In this case they're translated to N as currently we have
no way to store a substitution to anything other than ACGTN.

We may need to revisit this, but it needs the tag encoding moving from

Fixed bam<->cram flag conversion to cope with optical duplicates and

Bug fix when handling unmapped sequences having mapping qualities and
cigar strings. Also no longer clear mate reference ID if the mate is
unmapped - it may be stored adjacent to this sequence and have "=" for
the ref name.

Mapped + unmapped pairs are no used together to identify template
length.

Removal of some debugging output.

1) Corrected a lot of the data-types used for codecs, BYTE vs INT etc.
Also implemented BYTE and INT specific variants of the huffman codecs.

TODO: implement BYTE versions of the various integer codecs, or at
very least check and fail when we're reading a byte and only have
integer versions available.

2) Corrected handling of unmapped data. It now properly gets its own
slice where it should do.

3) Fixed flag and mate-flag corrections for mate-downstream
environments.

Fixed the itf8 code again. The previous decoder change was incorrect
as the encoder was at fault, not the decoder. This now seems to work
correctly with -ve numbers and is interchangeable with the Java
implementation.

Replaced the cram_SAM_hdr structure with a complete bam_file_t
structure (via typedef). This allows reuse of the bam header parsing
code. It needs fixing properly though to make a common sub-struct used
by both file formats.

Added a (currently hacky!) bam_add_rg() function. Note it expects the
header string to have been allocated large enough already, as realloc
would break the pointers used in the rg_hash unless we redefine it to
be volatile keys. The entire header implementation needs a big
overhaul.

Implemented the UNKNOWN read-group for files missing a read-group. The
code can store read-group -1 perfectly fine, but this causes Java to
get an array underflow so it is currently mandatory to generate an
UNKNOWN read-group.

TODO:

TO FIX STILL:
Backed out the freeing of data in bam_parse_header due to attempting

structures need a good reorganisation. For now we'll accept a minor
leakage of RG fields as a tradeoff for working.

Added support for a hash index of multiple files. This means we can
have a single HASH= line on our TRACE_PATH while transparently
fetching traces from any number of .tar files. (For now this is only
supported with tar and not SFF.)

Hash_list has been updated to list the originating .tar file when
outputting in long format.

Also added a -m option to hash_tar to provide a mapping from old to
new tar entry names. This allows us to rename the contents of a tar
file (eg to strip off a .ztr suffix or change case) incase Gap4 has
been incorrectly contructed with different trace filenames in it. (Yes
it's just a hack option.)

Overhaul of endianness detection.

- We still use autoconf, but now generate an os.h from os.h.in with
  either SP_LITTLE_ENDIAN or SP_BIG_ENDIAN already hard-coded within
  it. This avoids issues when non-autoconf programs linking against
  io_lib include os.h.

- As an exception to the above, MacOS X FAT binaries will defined
  neither of the endian parameters (as it's impossible to know this at
  configure time) and falls back to the auto-dtection based on CPU
  time. Hopefully the same applies for any cross-compilation. NOTE:
  this requires a modern autoconf with the 4th argument to
  AC_C_BIGENDIAN macro. (3.65 has it, but 3.61 does not. I am unsure
  which version inbetween it appeared.)

- We now include io_lib_config.h in all .c files and in no .h
  files. This avoids complications of trying to include io_lib header
  files (os.h in particular) from another program using autoconf
  that's also defined HAVE_CONFIG_H.

- Removed False/True from os.h. Only false was used and only in two
  scf source files. I just explicitly check vs 0 now.

See:
https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2945526&group_id=100316&atid=627060
submitted by Jordan Mendler.

Fixed negative quality values - these shouldn't happen when specifying
SCALE as PH(red), but -1 appears in ABI SOLiD files.

Fixed N vs . character. We no longer force ambiguity bases to N,
keeping . in use for SOLiD data.

Improved the use of the "-c" option. The program will now
automatically find the appropriate CNF chunk, so -c is only necessary
when both CNF1 and CNF4 are present and you wish to request data comes
from CNF1 instead.

This only surfaces when using the library from your own tools as the
programs supplied with io_lib never read more than a single sff read.

Moved io_lib from staden source tree into it's own top-level
subversion directory, complete with tags, branches, and trunk.

For now the old tagged copies of io_lib are still in the staden/tags/
directory with tag names io_lib-<version>, but that is perhaps right
and proper (as it's where the code actually resided at that release
number).

Preparations for 1.12.0 release.

There is now proper versioning support for the library too. The soname
used here is libstaden-read.so.1, to distinguish from any earlier
dynamic libraries. (The ABI definitely has changed over the years in
incompatible manners.)

Re-enabled libtool, with a workaround to remove the infuriating rpath
nonsense. (It's now 2x slower to configure, 3x slower to compile and
10x more anguish to debug, but at least I can sleep at night knowing
rpath hasn't had it's wicked way with the code.)

   A /staden/trunk/src/io_lib/io_lib/Makefile

Added a Makefile for io_lib/io_lib; so the library itself. This isn't
expected to be used normally, but it allows me to test local copies of
io_lib (under a different library name) in conjunction with the staden
source tree before releasing either.

Remove use of curl-config --libs. While useful for linking against
static libraries, it just adds unwanted dependencies in a dynamic
build environment.

   M /staden/trunk/src/io_lib/io_lib/compress.h

Made pipe2() internal as it's not used anywhere else yet.

Also renamed from pipe2 to pipe_into. This resolves SF bug #2629155;
pipe2 has been added as a system function to glibc 2.9 as an interface
to the new (2.6.27+) kernel system call of the same name.

failed.

Bug fix to srf_next_ztr_flags. When faced with a ZTR header with no
ZTR chunks in the srf data block header it erroneously set mf_end to
zero instead of the actual length.

I've never seen these occur with the 1.0 solexa pipeline release though.



===============================================================================
2008-12-10  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* 1.11.6.1 released.

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	Removal of debugging output.

2008-12-10  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* 1.11.6 released.

2008-12-10  jkbonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	Fixed the add_qcal_chunk code so it doesn't assume that it can strlen
	the binary quality string.
	
	* man/man1/srf2fastq.1,
	* man/man1/srf_info.1:
	(10:17:27) Updated to reflect newly added options. 

	* progs/srf2fastq.c:
	(10:19:25) Merged in changes from Steven Leonard. - Extra options
	were added to provide explicit control over the read   names
	(whether to add /1, /2, ...) and filenames. - Renamed -p (primer)
	as -e (explicit). 

	* progs/srf_info.c:
	(10:20:18) Merged in changes from Steven Leonard - Call srf_destroy
	before exiting in various failure cases. This has   no real impact
	except to make it easier to look for real memory leaks. 

2008-12-09  jkbonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/srf2fastq.c:
	(10:20:00) Fixed an error with split file mode - it read past the
	end of an array.
	
	We now check the SCALE option on CNF4 and CNF1 chunks and convert
	the data accordingly to phred. 

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(10:23:31) Merged in some of the changes made by Chris Saunders
	from Illumina.
	
	Most significantly this now stores CNF1 data in log-odds format and
	sets SCALE meta-data accordingly. This makes srf2illumina work
	better as it doesn't go from log-odds to phred back to log-odds,
	destroying data in rounding. 

	* tests/data/slx_out/both.info,
	* tests/data/slx_out/both.srf,
	* tests/data/slx_out/proc.info,
	* tests/data/slx_out/proc.srf,
	* tests/data/slx_out/proc.srf.indexed,
	* tests/data/slx_out/raw.info,
	* tests/data/slx_out/raw.srf,
	* tests/data/slx_out/test_run_4_134_369_182.srf,
	* tests/data/slx_out/both.run/4_PROGRAM_ID.txt:
	(12:26:13) Updated to accommodate illumina2srf version string
	change. 

	* progs/srf_filter.c:
	(12:28:30) Bad case of missing braces! 

2008-12-08  jkbonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* io_lib/compression.c:
	(12:32:38) Better error handling in tshift method 

	* io_lib/compress.c,
	* io_lib/compress.h:
	(12:33:40) Added remove_extension() function. (Not yet used by
	io_lib, but potentially handy and used by some external tools.)
	(Steven Leonard) 

	* progs/srf2solexa.c:
	(12:34:38) Bug fixed the qcal conversion - now use the correct
	lookup table and added .499 to match the rounding used in
	solexa2srf.c. 

	* progs/srf2fastq.c,
	* progs/srf_filter.c,
	* progs/srf_info.c:
	(12:35:40) Merged in Steven Leonard's changes.
	
	These mainly involve better support for multiple index blocks in
	SRF files (eg concatenated files), support for splitting output
	files in srf2fastq, and extra reporting options in srf_info. 

	* io_lib/ztr.c,
	* io_lib/ztr.h:
	(17:15:58) Added const to string params in ztr_add_text. 

	* io_lib/srf.c,
	* io_lib/srf.h:
	(17:23:53) New function srf_next_ztr_flags. This is the same as the
	old srf_next_ztr function except with the addition of an extra
	argument into which the SRF Data Block 'flags' value is copied when
	returning the next trace. 

===============================================================================
2008-12-04  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* 1.11.5 released.

2008-12-03  jkbonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(17:29:10) Fixed qcal format so it now correctly drops quality by
	the 64 offset added in the fastq-a-like strings.
	
	Fixed a bug with the 2-file calibration mode (-qf and -qr). A
	single combined -qf alone works fine, but when pasting the split
	file mode (fwd + rev) a newline crept halfway into the quality
	string causing the reverse qualities to be shifted by one. 

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(17:29:56) Bumped version to 1.11 

2008-12-02  jkbonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/srf_filter.c:
	(14:38:58) Removed some major memory leaks. 

	* io_lib/srf.c,
	* progs/srf_filter.c:
	(15:01:04) More memory leak fixed (although tiny). 

2008-10-23  jkbonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/hash_sff.c:
	(14:08:19) Added support for outputting only the table of contents
	to a new file without copying the existing sff files. This is
	useful if we have the original sff files in an archive that we
	cannot modify. 

2008-10-07  jkbonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/Makefile.am:
	(16:02:51) Added extract_fastq to the list of programs to build. 

2008-09-29  jkbonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* man/man1/illumina2srf.1,
	* man/man1/srf2fasta.1,
	* man/man1/srf2fastq.1,
	* man/man1/srf_info.1,
	* man/man1/srf_list.1:
	(13:40:01) Added the first draft of several manual pages. 

	* man/man1/illumina2srf.1:
	(13:44:09) *** empty log message *** 

	* progs/Makefile.am,
	* progs/srf_list.c:
	(14:00:22) Added new program: srf_list. This lists or counts the
	sequence names within an SRF file. 

	* io_lib/srf.c:
	(14:01:38) The srf_next_block_details now uses the trace_body
	struct held within the srf struct. This means it can be queried
	after a successful call and is utilised by srf_list to obtain the
	trace body size. 

	* man/man1/srf_index_hash.1:
	(14:08:36) First draft of man page. 

2008-09-18  jkbonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(12:59:37) Fixed a bug with parsing the directory name. If it fails
	it left the run number in an inconsistent state.
	
	This shouldn't cause issues in production pipelines, but does if
	you copy the files out of the run folders. 

	* io_lib/srf.c,
	* io_lib/srf.h,
	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(16:33:45) Overhauled the SRF indexing code.
	
	Much of the indexing code in srf_index_hash.c has been moved over
	to srf.c so it can be used by other programs.  An API has been
	created too so it is now far easier to create, add to and save an
	index.
	
	Added support for writing indexes in illumina2srf. Note that now if
	no index is written we also write out 8 bytes of zero, indicating
	the length of the index is zero. (This is required by more recent
	versions of the SRF specification.)
	
	Still to do: tools such as srf_filter should be updating the index
	(or at least removing the old ones). This will now be easier to do
	with these code updates.
	
	Updated the tests to check the new illumina2srf -i option too.

	* 1.11.4 released.

2008-09-11  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* Makefile.am,
	* bootstrap,
	* configure.in:
	(08:43:42) Updated for version number and inclusion of tests dir. 

	* io_lib/Attic/Makefile.in:
	(08:43:55) Removed due to being auto-generated from Makefile.am 

	* io_lib/os.h:
	(08:44:56) Tidy up of endianness detection. I split apart the
	endian step from the os-components (no strdup, etc). Also changed
	the order so that when using autoconf the automatically detected
	settings override any existing assumptions from os.h. 

	* io_lib/hash_table.h:
	(08:46:10) Included sys/types.h for off_t type. 

	* CHANGES,
	* ChangeLog,
	* README:
	(10:25:27) Final tweaks for preparing 1.11.4 

	* io_lib/srf.h:
	(10:52:37) Changed block_type from char to int. This cures a
	problem on PowerMac (PPC) running Debian where char is by default
	an unsigned type, meaning it cannot be compared to EOF (-1). 

	* tests/srf_index.test,
	* tests/data/slx_out/Attic/test_run:4:134:369:182.srf,
	* tests/data/slx_out/test_run_4_134_369_182.srf:
	(11:09:11) Renamed test_run:4:134:369:182.srf to
	test_run_4_134_369_182.srf as Windows cannot cope with colons in
	filenames, causing the tar file to fail to unpack. Grrr.

	* tests/data/slx_out/both.run/s_4_0134_sig2.txt:
	(15:53:42) First pass at a "make check" target. Currently this is
	centred around the newer code, specifically SRF support. 

	* tests/Makefile.am,
	* tests/illumina2srf.test,
	* tests/srf2fasta.test,
	* tests/srf2fastq.test,
	* tests/srf2illumina.test,
	* tests/srf_filter.test,
	* tests/srf_index.test,
	* tests/srf_info.test:
	(16:13:19) Fixed tests to use $outdir for output directory so we
	can neatly tidy it up for make distclean. Without this make
	distcheck fails. 

	* tests/Makefile.am,
	* tests/illumina2srf.test,
	* tests/srf2fasta.test,
	* tests/srf2fastq.test,
	* tests/srf2illumina.test,
	* tests/srf_filter.test,
	* tests/srf_index.test,
	* tests/srf_info.test:
	(16:43:33) Fixed some bashisms and switched to make use of srcdir
	instead of top_srcdir/tests. 

2008-09-09  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* acinclude.m4:
	(13:27:35) Fixed the LIBCURL_CHECK_CONFIG code to not believe the
	output from "curl-config --libs". We try -lcurl first off to see if
	that also works. The reason is simply that curl-config --libs
	typically loves to explicitly specify all the implicit
	dependencies, such as -lssl -lcrypto -ldl, etc. This in turn locks
	compiled io_lib libraries and binaries into requiring very specific
	version of system libraries. 

	* io_lib/Attic/Makefile.in:
	(13:27:57) *** empty log message *** 

	* io_lib/compression.c:
	(13:30:24) Minor speed tweaks to qshift and unqshift 

	* io_lib/mFILE.c,
	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(13:31:41) Added include of io_lib_config.h for autoconf builds so
	that the ftello and similar functions get the correct prototypes. 

	* io_lib/srf.c,
	* io_lib/srf.h:
	(13:32:44) Made partial_decode_ztr non-static and added it, along
	with ztr_dup and construct_trace_name to the external header file
	for use in other parts of io_lib. 

	* progs/Makefile.am,
	* progs/srf_filter.c,
	* progs/srf_info.c:
	(13:36:40) Added two new programs from Steven Leonard.
	
	srf_info: dumps out basic information on the contents of an SRF    
	      file, including the read name prefixes used, how many	   
	  DBs per DBH and frequencies of ZTR chunk and meta-data	 
	strings.
	
	srf_filter: a tool to produce new srf files by filtering in or out 
		data from an existing srf file. This can be performed	   
	    either at the entire trace level (eg tagged as good or	   
	bad) or also at individual ZTR chunk levels (eg processed      
	data only). 

	* progs/srf2fasta.c,
	* progs/srf2fastq.c:
	(13:37:37) Include string.h for additional prototypes (for -Wall
	-Wno-paranthesis compilations). 

	* progs/srf_extract_hash.c:
	(13:38:47) Major overhaul from Steven Leonard. It now supports a
	-fastq option to output fastq instead of ZTR files and optionally
	can use calibrated or non-calibrated confidence values too. 

	* progs/srf_extract_linear.c:
	(13:39:44) Added support for SRFB_NULL_INDEX so that srf files with
	a blank index do not causes crashes. 

	* progs/srf_index_hash.c:
	(13:40:44) Added extra error checking from Steven Leonard to spot
	duplicate read names. The new -c option also allows checking of an
	existing srf file without attempting to write a new index. 

2008-09-08  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(08:40:20) Fixed bug reported by Robert Sanders. The fwd matrix was
	being written twice on paired-end runs instead of fwd+reverse. 

	* COPYRIGHT,
	* io_lib/open_trace_file.c,
	* io_lib/sff.c:
	(10:56:46) Updated 454's copyright notice (following correspondence
	from Jim Knight at 454) to explicitly include permission to modify
	and redistribute the code.
	
	Also updated the GRL licence to be explicit rather than just an
	implied BSD style. 

2008-08-29  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* io_lib/deflate_interlaced.c:
	(09:00:39) Added external codes2codeset() function to turn
	bit-length arrays into codesets. Useful for tools that wish to use
	this code to use their own precomputed huffman trees. 

	* io_lib/deflate_interlaced.h:
	(09:00:53) *** empty log message *** 

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(09:01:21) Renamed ILLUMINA_GA_PARAMS and ILLUMINA_GA_PARAMS2 to
	ILLUMINA_GA_BUSTARD_PARAMS and ILLUMINA_GA_FIRECREST_PARAMS. 

2008-08-26  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(11:07:09) Added the second .params file (Data directory).
	
	Major reduction in memory usage when adding the .params files; we
	only hold this in memory for the first ZTR file per DBH as it ends
	up in the header anyway. (This also speeds things up too.) 

2008-08-08  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(10:21:28) Fixed a bug in parse_4_float when handling strings with
	leading zeroes after the point, eg "17.04". Fortunately this is
	never triggered in the solexa data as it's always one single value
	after the decimal point. 

	* configure.in,
	* io_lib/os.h:
	(10:33:29) Applied Chris Saunders' patch to use autoconf for
	checking machine endianness. 

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(16:52:10) Added a MAX_READS_PER_DBH #define to solexa2srf
	(defaults at 10000) to reduce the maximum number of traces per tile
	we process between SRF data block headers. This helps reduce the
	maximum memory usage which is especially important on dense GA2
	runs where 200,000 clusters in a tile can be achieved.
	
	Also fixed a bug with using -qf/-qr when not supplying a list of
	tiles consecutively starting with tile 1. 

2008-08-05  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* io_lib/srf.c:
	(08:18:14) Fixed memory leak in srf_next_ztr reported by Rob Egan.
	Triggered by srf2fastq -C. 

2008-07-24  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(15:47:32) Updated version to v1.10
	
	Added -pf/-pr parameters to allow the phasing files to be stored.
	By default it attempts to derive these filenames from the fwd/rev
	cycle numbers.
	
	Auto-compute the basecaller name and version string from the
	directory name. 

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(15:58:15) Bug fix to get_base_caller() so that it can identify the
	directory when given a full pathname to elsewhere other than the
	cwd. 

2008-07-18  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(15:54:51) No longer iterate through tiles printing up . or !
	depending on whether we encounter an error. Now it just aborts at
	the point of failure.
	
	Also made the parsing code more robust as in a couple specific
	cases it only wrote to stderr without actually generating a
	non-zero exit code.
	
	These mean the tool is more amenable to running in a production
	pipeline. If it gets any error at all it'll be more obvious and
	forces attention. 

2008-07-11  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(11:35:28) Updated the rounding of int/nse/sig2 to all use the
	rint() function to round to closest integer value. Previously
	int/nse rounded down and sig2 rounded closest. (Although the
	rounding on sig2 was via +/- 0.5 and so the half-way cases
	sometimes give different answers to the new code using rint()).
	
	It has a very minor impact overall, but it is now consistent. 

===============================================================================
2008-07-09  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* 1.11.3 released.

2008-07-09  jkbonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* io_lib/mFILE.c:
	* io_lib/Read.c,
	* io_lib/mFILE.h:
	(13:54:59) Fixed a bug visible with "extract_seq -fasta_out -fofn f
	-output f.fasta" whereby only the last file was visible. This is
	due to the mFILE mechanism and an explicit fseek upon writing each
	file. Fixed this by using an extended freopen option ("wbx" instead
	of "wb") to override this feature. It's not ideal, but gets the job
	done - I hope. 

2008-07-08  jkbonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* io_lib/srf.c,
	* io_lib/srf.h:
	(13:22:57) Added SRFB_NULL_INDEX as an SRF block type. It's
	essentially type 0 and is defined to be 8 long (with 7 more zeros).
	The purpose is to transparently gloss over the 8-zeros that may be
	on the end of some files indicating a missing index block. 

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(13:34:40) MAJOR BUG FIX!
	
	Fixed a bug in reorder_ztr() whereby the sorted order of multiple
	chunks of the same chunk type were not "stable". The result of this
	is that 3 SMP4 chunks (say A, B, C) may end up sorted A, B, C with
	nchunks==9 and C, A, B with nchunks==15. Given that an optimisation
	means that we change the number of chunks depending on whether
	we've encoded HUFF chunks this causes a "corruption" in as far as
	the correct data is stored but with potentially an incorrect
	meta-data block for the first SMP4 chunk.
	
	See srf_fix.c to reverse this problem.
	
	Also added a warning regarding the -C option and -qf option. These
	are inherently incompatible (right now) as purity filtered data is
	not calibrated.
	
	Updated version to v1.8 

2008-06-12  jkbonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/srf2fasta.c,
	* progs/srf2fastq.c:
	(10:44:23) Removed memory leaks from using ztr_find_chunks and not
	freeing the result. 

===============================================================================
2008-06-04  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* 1.11.2 released.

2008-06-04  jkbonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* docs/ZTR_format:
	(13:06:36) Added some text regarding *ideas* for version 2. These
	are not officially part of any stanard yet. 

	* io_lib/compression.c:
	(13:06:54) Comment change only. 

2008-06-03  jkbonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* io_lib/srf.c:
	(16:23:50) Applied bug fix from John Emhoff: srf_read_xml was
	incorrectly interpreting the XML length as the length of the XML
	string rather than the entire SRF block itself including header. It
	now agrees with srf_write_xml, which interpreted this correctly. 

2008-05-23  jkbonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* docs/ZTR_format:
	(08:38:05) Documented TYPE meta-data for SMP4 and removed the
	comment about being mutually exclusive with SAMP.
	
	Added explanation of log-odds vs phred scales.
	
	Added CNF1 chunk type (how did I miss this before?). 

2008-05-21  jkbonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* io_lib/srf.c:
	(09:12:23) Fixed memory leak in construct_trace_name. (Patch from
	John Emhoff at Heliocos.) 

2008-05-14  jkbonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(13:08:34) Fixed floating point to integer rounding of trace data
	to round to closest instead of floor(value). 

	* io_lib/srf.c,
	* io_lib/srf.h,
	* progs/solexa2srf.c,
	* progs/srf2fasta.c,
	* progs/srf2fastq.c,
	* progs/srf2solexa.c,
	* progs/srf_dump_all.c:
	(14:13:15) Added changes from Camil Toma (albeit modified here and
	there) to incorporate the -C option to various tools. This allows
	for chastity filtered data to be stored in SRF, but tagged as being
	bad data. We then get the option to filter it on extraction
	instead. 

2008-05-13  jkbonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(14:25:53) Reverted the footer position change in encode_ztr() back
	(to the 20th February 2008) to taking out the meta-data into the
	header block too. Although this contains variable data (OFFS=value)
	it's the same for all members of a tile. 

2008-05-08  jkbonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* io_lib/open_trace_file.c:
	(11:06:53) Sped up searching in SRF files by stripping off the
	directory name when calling srf_find_trace(). (It got to this
	before eventually, but only after searching various false
	combinations.)

	* io_lib/os.h:
	(11:07:31) Minor change to prevent errors when compiling within the
	Staden Package. No impact for autoconf version. 

	* io_lib/srf.c:
	(11:08:18) Fixed bug in srf_find_trace that caused it to rarely
	fail to find a trace when querying the hash table. 

2008-05-06  jkbonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* docs/ZTR_format:
	(11:44:51) Fixed error in the pictoral diagram describing the magic
	number. (It is correct everywhere else.) 

	* io_lib/open_trace_file.c:
	(14:27:24) Added SRF interfaces to open_trace_file meaning we can
	now try specifying traces file fubar.srf/tname or
	TRACE_PATH=SRF=fubar.srf and tname. 

	* configure.in,
	* io_lib/ztr.c,
	* progs/Makefile.am,
	* progs/solexa2srf.c,
	* progs/srf2solexa.c:
	(15:35:36) Implemented Come Raczy's (Illumina) changes. These
	involved renaming the solexa2srf and srf2solexa tools to be
	illumina2srf and srf2illumina and the addition of qcal support in
	preparation for the GA v1.0 release.
	
	Note that currently the filenames are the same as before, in order
	to preserve change history. 

	* Makefile:
	(15:43:33) Added srf.o to the Staden Package Makefile (NB: not part
	of the autoconf system.) 

2008-04-15  jkbonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* io_lib/hash_table.c:
	(15:09:41) Initialises pb and pc in hash() function when using
	HASH_FUNC_JENKINS3. Bug reported by Cristian Goina. 

2008-04-08  jkbonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(11:22:33) Fixed a code inefficiency when using -qf and -qr. 

	* io_lib/srf.c,
	* io_lib/srf.h:
	(16:16:55) Fixed bugs regarding binary format read_id suffixes,
	reported and mostly patched by Cristian Goina.
	
	The srf_trace_body_t struct now has a read_id_length field.
	
	The srf_construct_trace_body() function has an extra argument to
	pass in the length, or -1 if unknown (it'll use strlen then).
	
	New function srf_write_pstringb to write binary pstrings, avoiding
	the requirement for strlen(). 

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(16:21:57) Added extra arg to srf_construct_trace_body call (see
	srf.c change log).
	
	Fixed a bug introduced in the recent efficiency improvements for
	-qf/-qr. These meant that many sequences were incorrectly skipped. 

2008-04-07  jkbonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(08:54:06) Increased the estimation of number of bytes per cycle in
	the allocation in get_sig(). 

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(15:11:06) Fixed error that crept in when error checking was added
	to compress_chunk calls. Missing curly braces meant that some
	chunks were not compressed while other chunks got needless
	additional layers of compression. 

2008-04-03  jkbonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(15:57:06) The defaults for -N and -n are now using the same naming
	conventions used in Gerald during the fastq generation steps. To do
	this is looks at the run folder root directory name to get the run
	date, machine name and run number. (These are available for use as
	%d, %m and %r in the format strings.)
	
	Calibrated confidence values are now automatically included if the
	-qf or -qr parameters are used (specifying the fastq filename).
	Note this only works currently if the number of bases after
	calibration is the same as the number before. The calibrated
	confidence values are written in a CNF1 ztr chunk (in addition to
	the existing CNF4 chunk for uncalibrated values) and are rescaled
	to adhere to the phred scale (-10 * log10(1-P)).
	
	Added meta-data to the confidence chunks (CNF1 and CNF4) with a
	SCALE key. The value is either LO (log-odds) or PH (phred). This
	increases file size somewhat as it's written once per trace, but
	the long-term goal is to upgrade ZTR to support the ability to
	specific default meta-data keys/values. 

	* progs/srf2fastq.c:
	(15:57:58) Added a -c option to output calibrated confidence values
	instead of uncalibrated ones.
	
	Plus additionally it should be able to handle multiple archives on
	the command line instead of a single one. 

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(17:00:28) Added support for using popen() to gzip -cd instead of
	using gzopen. The reason is that it's between 3 and 5 times faster
	doing that. I'm unsure why, but overall it sped up solexa2srf -r 3
	fold when the Firecrest data is gzipped. 

2008-04-02  jkbonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(09:14:45) Fixed the footer(aka body) position calculation so it
	works still on trace files containing no trace data at all. Ie
	solexa2srf -P. 

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(09:28:02) Added Camil Toma's (Broad) changes to support -mf and
	-mr paremeters. These provide finer grained control over the
	filenames of the forward and reverse matrices. 

	* progs/srf2solexa.c:
	(09:29:04) Added Camil Toma's (Broad) changes to extract text files
	embedded in ZTR TEXT chunks. 

	* progs/srf_dump_all.c:
	(10:54:29) Added Camil Toma's (Broad) changes to srf_dump_all.
	These add multiple new features, increasing the source length 7
	fold.

	* progs/srf2solexa.c,
	* progs/srf_dump_all.c:
	(10:56:06) Fixed bug reported by Cristian Goina (JCVI): we now use
	srf_open with mode "rb" instead of "r". This resolves an issue on
	Windows/DOS when dealing with binary data including ^Z characters
	being interpreted as EOF. 

	* progs/srf_dump_all.c:
	(11:05:25) Fixed missing newlines in the standard "dump" format. 

2008-03-20  jkbonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* io_lib/hash_table.c,
	* progs/hash_list.c:
	(09:45:07) Added more includes of io_lib_config.h to ensure 64-bit
	file support works correctly. 

2008-03-13  jkbonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(09:32:15) Fixed an error when passing in fully qualified
	pathnames. We now chdir() to the directory containing the seq.txt
	file and work from there.
	
	Also some functions involved in supporting fastq files with
	callibrated confidence values. This is unfinished and needs more
	work, specifically it doesn't do anything with the sequence/qual
	yet (just parses it) and the entire operation should probably work
	from the GERALD directory instead of the Bustard directory. Hence
	for now the -qf and -qr options are undocumented. 

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(11:53:32) Incorporated Come Razy's changes to solexa2srf, with a
	few modifications to adhere to C89 instead of C9X C standards.
	
	These add support for the new Illumina IPAR file format via the -I
	command line option. 

2008-02-29  jkbonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* acinclude.m4,
	* configure.in:
	(14:10:53) Fixed autoconf build environment for Fedora. We no
	longer assume /usr/lib is a valid default for zlib, instead relying
	on either the compiler to find it or an explicit --with-zlib
	option.
	
	See SF bug 1898427

===============================================================================
2008-02-20  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* 1.11.0 released.

2008-02-20  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

        * progs/srf2fastq.c:
	(12:49:09) Removed the ztr2read conversion and operate
	directly on
	the ztr struct. This is now 25% faster.
		
        * progs/srf2fasta.c:
        (12:49:30) New program - trivially modelled on srf2fastq.c
	
	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(10:33:36) Altered the header/footer split for ZTR to stop just
	before the metadata part of a SMP4 chunk. Previously it was after
	this and just before the data, but now we can have multiple SMP4
	chunks in a single ZTR file this was breaking things. 

2008-02-18  James Bonfield <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* io_lib/ztr.h:
	(16:53:52) Added ZTR_TYPE_REGN definition. We have no explicit code
	to implement this yet in ztr.c, but for now it's in solexa2srf. 

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(16:55:38) Added support for specifying the start coord for the 2nd
	read in a paired-read run (solexa2srf -2 <cycle.no.>). This also
	adds a REGN chunk to the ZTR file and stores the second matrix file
	too. 

	* progs/srf2solexa.c:
	(16:56:39) Major overhaul to support raw data as well as processed
	data. Still to-do: write out .params and the two matrix files. 

2008-02-15  James Bonfield <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* io_lib/srf.c:
	(10:05:54) Fixed memory leak in srf_read_trace_body usage. This was
	primarily visible from within srf_index_hash. 

	* progs/srf2solexa.c,
	* io_lib/srf.c,
	* progs/srf_index_hash.c,
	* progs/srf_extract_hash.c:
	(12:35:19) Added include of io_lib-config.h to ensure picking up
	the correct compiler definitions for 64-bit file size support. 

	* progs/srf_extract_linear.c:
	(12:40:55) Fixed memory leaks. 

2008-02-14  James Bonfield <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(17:02:42) Don't bother performing ZTR_FORM_TSHIFT transformation
	on the solexa noise data as it doesn't help it at all. Also hard
	coded the interlaced huffman to operate in batches of 2 instead of
	8 for noise data for the same reason. 

	* io_lib/ztr_translate.c:
	(17:07:15) ztr2read() now correctly handles translation of ZTR
	files with multiple samples in. Specifically it only sets the Read
	struct baseline and trace[ACGT] arrays when the TYPE meta-data
	field is blank, PROC or A,C,G T.
	
	This fixes trace_dump etc on solexa srf files, (note that the srf
	files themselves were perfect valid anyway). 

2008-02-06  James Bonfield <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/extract_seq.c:
	(11:04:38) Use set_compression_method to explicitly disable gzipped
	output from extract_seq (which is by default on if the input is
	gzipped). 

	* io_lib/Makefile.in,
	* progs/Makefile.am,
	* progs/extract_qual.c:
	(11:04:59) Added Steven Leonard's extract_qual program (derived
	from extract_seq). 

2008-01-28  James Bonfield <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(09:47:42) Sped up parse_4_int and parse_4_float substantially. 

2008-01-25  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* Tagged iolib-1-11-0b8

        * progs/solexa2srf.c:
        (11:38:34) Fixed small memory leak in zfopen/zfclose.

        Fixed a bug where reorder_ztr could put CNF4 before BASE,
        breaking
        the decoding.

        Added support for loading solexa matrix and params files into
        appropriately named TEXT key/value pairs. It also adds the
        PROGRAM_ID there now too.

        Sped up chastity filtering. We now only read the line of text
        rather than decode it for data that is filtered.

        Minor tweaks to program usage output.

        * progs/trace_dump.c:
        (11:39:09) Updated output to be more inline with
        srf_dump_all. Also
        now supports baseline properly.

        * progs/ztr_dump.c:
        (11:39:34) Added ZTR_FORM_XRLE2, ZTR_FORM_QSHIFT and
        ZTR_FORM_TSHIFT.

2008-01-24  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

        * io_lib/ztr.c,
        * io_lib/ztr.h:
        (17:17:52) Two new utility functions that are *long* overdue.

        ztr_new_chunk() - creates and initialises a new chunk in a ztr
        struct.

        ztr_add_text() - adds arbitrary key/value pairs to the TEXT
        chunk,
                     creating it if required.

2008-01-22  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

        * io_lib/srf.c,
        * io_lib/srf.h:
        (11:07:40) Allow for srf_read_index_hdr() to be used to read
        an index internal to the file rather than at the end of the
	file. To accommodate this an extra "no_seek" argument has been
	added.

        * progs/solexa2srf.c:
        (11:10:56) Support multiple trace channels (raw "int" & noise,
        in addition to or instead of the processed data).

        Input data may now optionally be compressed.

        Added a -c option to do chastity filtering via the .qhg files.

        Improved the dynamic range filtering. We no longer trim all
	negative values in preference for high positive values. Instead we
	set the clip points to trim the least number of total values.

        * progs/srf2solexa.c:
        (11:11:35) Fixed the baseline subtraction. It now uses the
        correct value instead of a hardcoded 32768.

        * progs/srf_extract_linear.c:
        (11:12:15) Changed to use the new srf_read_index_hdr arguments.

        * progs/srf_index_hash.c:
        (11:13:12) Improved index support when the input is
        concatenated SRF files already containing indices. It now
	overwrites the last index.

        * progs/ztr_dump.c:
        (11:13:47) Added display of meta-data TYPE field for trace
        sample chunks.

2008-01-14  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

        * io_lib/srf.c,
        * io_lib/srf.h,
        * progs/srf_index_hash.c:
        (16:57:36) Bug fixes to do with reading and writing the index
        format. We incorrectly handled having null dbhFile and
        containerFile elements, plus also computed the index size wrong
	for these fields too.

===============================================================================
2008-01-11  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* 1.11.0b7 released.

	* io_lib/srf.c:
	(11:35:09) IMPORTANT BUG FIX: The SRF Data Block Header
	had the blockSize field 4 bytes too large, so SRF files produced
	did not conform to the standard.
	Also fixed SRF reading support for when headerBlob is zero length.
	We then delay ztr decoding until we've read the actual data blob.

2007-12-12  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* io_lib/srf.c,
	* io_lib/srf.h,
	* progs/srf_index_hash.c:
	(18:50:46) Updates to SRF 1.3. This includes removal of	the readID
	counter and added support for printf style formatting. It also has
	some tweaks to the format for the index (32-bit vs 64-bit and
	dbh/container file strings).

	Both versions have therefore been bumped (SRF 1.3 and index 1.01).

	TODO: support for extracting data from an SRF file that's split
	with container headers, trace headers and trace bodies all in
	separate files.

2007-11-06  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* README,
	* CHANGES
	Updated 

	* progs/Makefile.am:
	(10:09:33) Added srf_extract_hash; demonstration of using
	srf_find_trace to query a hash table index. 

	* progs/srf_extract_hash.c:
	(10:09:34) Added srf_extract_hash; demonstration of using
	srf_find_trace to query a hash table index. 

	* srf/srf.h:
	(10:10:15) Bug fix: updated version string to 1.2. (We were already
	writing using the 1.2 standard but claiming 1.1) 

	* srf/srf.c:
	(10:12:04) Bug fix when using glibc: added explicit include of
	io_lib_config.h prior to stdio.h so the AC_SYS_LARGEFILE autoconf
	magic does its tricks. This is only required for glibc, which
	appears broken by default as it doesn't contain a prototype for
	fseeko despite exporting the system, unless explicit macros are
	defined. 

2007-11-02  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(13:57:30) Improved handling of out-of-range data. Specifically
	what happens when the minimum value in a trace is -40000 and the
	maximum value is +50000. We now clip -ve values if the range
	doesn't fit. 

	* ztr/ztr_translate.c:
	(13:59:41) Added SMP4 'OFFS' metadata and Read->baseline support
	when converting from read2ztr. 

2007-11-01  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* srf/srf.c:
	(14:24:30) More error checking paranoia in SRF support; given that
	fwrite() can sometimes claim success even when it failed we now
	explicitly call ferror and check fclose() return. 

	* ztr/FORMAT,
	* ztr/ztr.c,
	* ztr/ztr.h,
	* ztr/ztr_translate.c:
	(14:26:02) Better support for ZTR v1.2. We now correctly handle
	SAMP/SMP4 metadata fields and make use of OFFS when converting to
	Read. 

	* progs/solexa2srf.c,
	* progs/srf_dump_all.c:
	(14:26:35) Improved support for ztr OFFS metadata and removed the
	old crufty SHIFT_BY #define. 

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(17:35:58) Bug fix: we were missing the trailing nul of the trace
	OFFS metadata value.
	
	Also the setting of min_val when the range is too high was invalid.
	Note further work is needed here as we've already truncated to
	16-bit making it impossible to tell where the wraparound occurs. 

	* ztr/ztr.c,
	* ztr/ztr_translate.c:
	(18:00:55) Fixed memory leaks. 

2007-10-26  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/Makefile.am,
	* progs/srf2fastq.c:
	(10:35:56) Added srf2fastq conversion to demonstrate usage of
	read_sections() and as a benchmark for pure sequence+quality
	extraction. (It appears to cope at about 100,000 sequences/second.) 

	* ztr/deflate_interlaced.c,
	* ztr/deflate_interlaced.h:
	(10:38:04) Changed generate_code_set and huffman_codeset_destroy to
	keep the same huffman_codeset_t structure for all uses of one of
	the predetermined CODE_* codesets. 

	* ztr/ztr_translate.c:
	(10:40:37) ztr2read() now honours the read_sections() setting. To
	do this it also means it uncompresses data on the fly, but only for
	chunk types that it needs to. Hence this code no longer needs
	uncompress_ztr() calling first either. 

	* srf/srf.c,
	* srf/srf.h:
	(10:46:07) Moved some static local variables out of srf_next_ztr
	into the srf_t object. This means the code should be
	multi-threaded. 

	* ztr/FORMAT:
	(10:47:07) Current v1.3 draft 

	* ztr/Attic/deflate_simple.c,
	* ztr/Attic/deflate_simple.h:
	(10:50:32) Replaced by deflate_interlaced.[ch] some time ago. 

	* progs/srf2solexa.c:
	(11:35:59) Switched to using srf_next_ztr() in order to avoid
	repeated huffman codeset decoding. Now much faster.

	* progs/solexa2srf.c:

	again. (TODO: actually we don't need to encode it over and over
	again either.)

	but that's a later task), a substantial update to ZTR and a variety
	of SRF tools in progs.
	
	The old huffman_static.[ch] files were renamed and substantially
	worked upon to create deflate_interlaced.[ch].
	
	Added new compression types. xrle2, tshift and qshift. The latter
	two of these are very specific to trace and quality packings. May
	need to rename to be more generic.

	* ztr/compression.c:
	(15:28:12) Fixed a bug in run length encoding XRLE2 format when
	dealing with very long repeat runs. 

	* ztr/FORMAT-1.2:
	(15:34:26) Fixed error in XRLE description. 

	* ztr/FORMAT:
	(15:34:41) Further updates documenting version 1.3 changes 

2007-09-03  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* ztr/Attic/deflate_simple.c,
	* ztr/Attic/deflate_simple.h:
	(11:11:12) Mostly a rename from huffman_static to deflate_simple,
	but also a large overhaul and redesign. This code implements the
	huffman component of the Deflate algorithm. 

	* ztr/compression.c,
	* ztr/compression.h,
	* ztr/ztr.c,
	* ztr/ztr.h:

	deflate_simple. 

	* Makefile:
	* Makefile.am,
	* read/Makefile.am:
	* progs/ztr_dump.c:
	(11:35:50) Update for rename of huffman_static.h to
	deflate_simple.h 

2007-08-15  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* ztr/compression.c,
	* ztr/Attic/huffman_static.c,
	* ztr/Attic/huffman_static.h:
	(15:30:04) Major overhaul of huffman_static.c.
	
	It's been substantially tuned for speed and also has several bug
	fixes to ensure we have a consistent sort function before applying
	the canonical_codes function (which previously meant differing
	qsort implementations would give different codes). 

	* ztr/FORMAT-1.2:
	(15:31:58) Created a snapshot of FORMAT for ZTR v1.2 only 

2007-07-16  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* acinclude.m4,
	* configure.in:
	(08:03:42) Updated configure.in to support --with-lib=DIR. 

	* utils/files.c:
	(08:05:23) Switched from using tempnam() to tmpfile(). This meant
	recreating tmpfile() wrapper on MS Windows to avoid bugs with it
	always attempting to write to the root directory, regardless of
	user privs. 

	* utils/open_trace_file.c,
	* utils/os.h:
	(08:05:24) Switched from using tempnam() to tmpfile(). This meant
	recreating tmpfile() wrapper on MS Windows to avoid bugs with it
	always attempting to write to the root directory, regardless of
	user privs. 

	* progs/hash_extract.c:
	(09:01:39) Fixed bug on windows: we now set stdout to be binary
	mode first. 

	* utils/open_trace_file.c:
	(09:02:51) INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: On windows we now use semi-colon as
	the path separator. The reason is that with the MinGW getenv()
	seems to do "clever things" with PATH variables and consequently
	ends up corrupting our clumsy attempt of escaping colons in paths. 

2007-07-11  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* Makefile,
	* Makefile.am,
	* read/Makefile.am,
	* utils/hash_table.c,
	* utils/hash_table.h,
	* utils/jenkins_lookup3.c,
	* utils/jenkins_lookup3.h:
	(13:57:26) Added Bob Jenkins' lookup3.c code to the hash_table
	support. It also now uses this for 64-bit hashing. 

2007-07-06  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* ztr/Attic/huffman_static.c:
	(09:06:46) Bug fix to last commit - finish adding the CODE_ENGLISH
	and removal of other code sets. 

2007-07-05  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* plain/seqIOPlain.c:
	(08:27:43) For FASTA format files we now, eventually, read the
	first sequence. 

	* ztr/FORMAT,
	* ztr/Attic/huffman_static.c,
	* ztr/Attic/huffman_static.h,
	* ztr/ztr.c,
	* ztr/ztr.h:
	(08:28:30) Work-in-progress update to support HUFF chunks and
	STHUFF (static huffman) compression methods. 

	* progs/ztr_dump.c:
	(08:29:15) Updated to support the new static-huffman compression
	method. 

	* ztr/Attic/huffman_static.c,
	* ztr/Attic/huffman_static.h:
	(10:45:48) Removed potentially variable huffman trees (solexa
	trace, confidence values) and added an english text tree. This was
	based on War of the Worlds, The Gold Bug, 200000 Leagues Under the
	Sea and the "man ascii" unix manual page for a bit of variety. It
	also includes the SYM_ANY escape code for handling out-of-band
	data.

2006-08-07  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/convert_trace.c:
	(14:12:39) Added -signed and -noneg options to perform shifting of
	trace data to avoid the unsigned issues for TRACE. 

2006-07-18  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* utils/traceType.c:
	(13:44:13) Added support for anytr in str2int and int2str
	conversions. 

2006-07-06  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/hash_exp.c:
	(08:45:18) Use binary mode, for windows. 

	* progs/hash_exp.c:
	(09:20:20) Remove control-M from end of line when indexing ID
	lines. 

	* progs/hash_exp.c:

	* dependencies:
	(15:45:01) Fixed dependency generation for io_lib 

2006-07-04  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* utils/mFILE.c,
	* utils/mFILE.h:
	(13:43:28) Added mfcreate_from(). It has a usage syntax identical
	to mfreopen(), but unlike mfreopen() it doesn't do anything with
	the file pointer (neither closing ie or remembering it in the
	structure). 

	* progs/extract_fastq.c:
	(16:19:30) Pathname hacking and listed -ztr on command line. 

	* progs/extract_seq.c,
	* progs/makeSCF.c:
	(16:20:17) Added -ztr as a command line option. 

	* progs/hash_exp.c:
	(16:21:14) Hash_exp now outputs to the same file containing the
	experiment files (in appended hash-table mode). 

	* progs/hash_extract.c:
	(16:21:53) Bug fix: now only needs at least 1 filename specified
	when fofn mode is not in use. 

	* progs/hash_list.c:
	(16:22:40) error detection and protection 

2006-06-27  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* utils/mFILE.c:
	(11:16:21) Bug fix to the previous change: mstdin(), mstdout() and
	mstderr() now correctly mark their streams and read and write
	capable. 

	* utils/mFILE.c,
	* utils/mFILE.h:
	(15:48:15) Added mfdetach() to allow the file pointer to be closed
	without deallocating the mFILE structure.
	
	Also removed the mFILE->fname component and replaced uses with
	checks to mode & MF_WRITE. 

	* utils/mFILE.c,
	* utils/mFILE.h:
	(15:58:52) Corrected duff spelling! 

2006-06-26  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* utils/mFILE.c,
	* utils/mFILE.h:
	(16:47:30) Fixed a bug in mfflush whereby it could attempt to write
	HUGE amounts of data (-ve size) when files are truncated before
	flushing; it now fseeks before doing the write and checks if the
	size is +ve.
	
	Also fixed mfwrite to correctly reset the flush_pos record.
	
	Added a mode field to the mFILE structure so we can keep track of
	append and read-only flags. These are checked for in the mfwrite
	function so mfwrite now writes to the correct location when append
	mode is used (ie forced to the end of file) and it now returns 0
	when attempting to write to a read-only mFILE.

2006-06-20  awhitwham  <awhitwham@sanger.ac.uk>

	* ztr/compression.c,
	* ztr/compression.h,
	* ztr/ztr.c:
	(15:42:06) Added a ZTR_FORM_LOG2 compression technique. It's an
	experimental lossy compression and is turned off right now; the
	space saving was only about 10% and if we go lossy I want big
	changes not small ones. 

	* ztr/ztr.h:
	(15:42:07) Added a ZTR_FORM_LOG2 compression technique. It's an
	experimental lossy compression and is turned off right now; the
	space saving was only about 10% and if we go lossy I want big
	changes not small ones.

2006-06-14  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/convert_trace.c:
	(08:53:43) Added a -error option to request stderr goes to a file
	instead of stderr. (from Saul Kravitz) 

	* scf/misc_scf.c,
	* scf/read_scf.c,
	* scf/write_scf.c:
	(08:58:12) Renamed delta_samples[12] to be scf_delta_samples[12].
	(patch supplied by Saul Kravitz) 

	* scf/scf.h:
	(08:58:29) Renamed delta_samples[12] to be scf_delta_samples[12].
	(patch supplied by Saul Kravitz) 

	* utils/open_trace_file.c:
	(08:58:55) Comment update 

	* utils/open_trace_file.c:
	* Makefile:
	(16:28:29) Renamed USE_LIBCURL to be HAVE_LIBCURL to make it
	compatible with autoconf. 

	* bootstrap:
	(16:28:56) Added removal of io_lib-config 

	* acinclude.m4,
	* configure.in:
	(16:29:55) Added libcurl checking code (in acinclude.m4). 

	* io_lib-config.in:
	(16:31:18) New io_lib-config program to query the compile and link
	parameters needed when using io_lib. 

	* io_lib.m4:
	(16:46:32) Initial draft (unchecked) of autoconf macros for use by
	packages (in configure.in) that want to make use of io_lib. 

2006-06-13  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/Makefile:
	(11:50:47) Added ZLIB_INC include path. 

2006-06-09  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* utils/open_trace_file.c:
	(08:53:24) Somewhere along the line I managed to break the most
	common of all search mechanisms; local filenames on disk! Fixed
	find_file_dir(). 

2006-06-08  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* Makefile,
	* utils/open_trace_file.c:
	(13:21:59) Added libcurl support and made this the default instead
	of using WGET for URL based accesses. Fixed a bug in the old wget
	code also though involving handling of zero-sized replies.
	
	Removed the compressed file extension iteration code in
	find_file_dir as it's now included in the master open_trace_file
	function instead (and so was yielding stats on fubar.scf.gz.bz2 and
	similar). It's also now possible to turn off the compressed file
	extension iteration code by prefixing a search path element with a
	"|" symbol.
	
	Replaced RAWDATA environment with EXP_PATH and TRACE_PATH. These
	default back to RAWDATA when not defined. Created new functions
	named open_exp_file and open_exp_mfile which use EXP_PATH instead
	of TRACE_PATH. These allow for experiment files and trace files to
	share the same names (as is the case in external "trace servers")
	but use different accessor routes to return the data. 

	* utils/open_trace_file.h:
	(13:22:40) New prototypes or the open_exp_{file,mfile} code and
	iolib_[sg]et_{trace,exp}_path calls. 

	* progs/Makefile,
	* progs/hash_exp.c:
	(13:25:15) New program hash_exp. This allows for multiple
	experiment files to be concatenated together instead a single
	multi-sequence file and then be indexed (using hash_exp) to allow
	for a HASH=... EXP_PATH element to extract the data back out again. 

	* progs/convert_trace.c,
	* progs/extract_seq.c,
	* read/Read.c,
	* read/Read.h,
	* read/scf_extras.c,
	* read/translate.c:
	(13:28:29) Make use of open_exp_mfile instead of open_trace_mfile
	when we know we've explicitly requested a file in EXP format. This
	ensures we'll use the correct search path where appropriate.
	
	Also defined an ANYTR trace format which is identical to the old
	ANY format except that it excludes EXP and PLN (ie "ANY TRace").
	Again this is used internally to ensure we pick the correct search
	path when dealing with fetching traces and/or experiment files. 

	* utils/mFILE.c:
	(13:29:23) Fixed a bug in mfseek and mrewind. Both now clear the
	EOF flag. 

	* utils/traceType.c:
	(13:33:16) Bug fix to fdetermine_trace_type: now rewinds back. 

	* Makefile:
	(15:21:02) Fixed the include/.links target (added sff) 

	* progs/Makefile,
	* progs/extract_fastq.c:
	(15:22:24) Added extract_fastq program. 

2006-05-30  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* ztr/compression.c:
	(08:46:57) Fixed a bug in xrle(); it now correctly handles runs of
	256 or more. 

2006-04-12  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* read/Read.c:
	(10:53:27) Changed various fwrite_* functions to not close the FILE
	pointer given to them. 

2006-02-28  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* ztr/compression.c:
	(17:10:36) Fixed bug reading past memory in xrle(). (Thanks to
	Kathryn Beal for identifying this.) 

2006-02-27  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* ztr/ztr.c,
	* ztr/ztr.h:
	(14:40:06) Removed static from compress_chunk and uncompress_chunk.
	Added prototypes to ztr.h. 

2006-02-23  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* utils/read_alloc.c:
	(15:08:36) Fixed a bug in read_dup and not initialising read->info. 

	* utils/read_alloc.c:
	(16:00:44) Fixed typo. 

2006-02-20  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* utils/hash_table.c:
	(12:16:50) Allow HashTableAdd to take a non-string for the key. 

2006-01-26  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* utils/hash_table.c,
	* utils/hash_table.h:
	(09:37:02) Fixed HashTableAdd with non-string keys and without
	HASH_NONVOLATILE_KEYS defined. It used strdup, but now allocates
	and memcpys.
	
	Added HashTableDel and HashTableRemove functions. HashTableDel
	removes and destroys a specified HashItem. HashTableRemove removes
	and destroys all items attached to a given key.

	* configure.in:
	(14:35:00) Update for 1.9.2 

2005-12-09  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* configure.in:
	(17:32:31) Added AC_CHECK_LIB calls for nsl and socket
	(gethostbyname and socket). Needed for Solaris compilations. 

2005-11-16  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/extract_seq.c:
	(14:14:16) Used open_trace_mfile instead of open_trace_file to
	avoid the need for temporary files and hence speeds this up. 

	* read/Read.c:
	(14:23:23) fwrite_reading now frees the temporary mFILE it created. 

	* read/Read.h,
	* read/translate.c:
	(14:45:41) Added private_data and private_size to the Read
	structure & populate from SCF. 

	* utils/compress.c:
	(14:48:51) mfreopen_compressed no longer closes the original FILE*.
	This makes it backwards compatible once more with the original
	version and also cures a bug whereby the old file pointer was often
	left open, leading to running out of file descriptors. 

	* utils/mFILE.c:
	(15:05:51) Fixed uninitialised check when filename was specified
	but not found in mfload. 

	* utils/read_alloc.c:
	(15:17:01) Added private_data to read struct 

2005-11-10  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/hash_extract.c:
	(11:32:06) Now returns an error code (to the calling process) if it
	failed to extract a sequence. 

	* utils/hash_table.c:
	(11:33:07) Fixed problem in hashquery when searching for something
	that has a hash key not present (ie empty hash bucket). 

===============================================================================
2005-10-27  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* bootstrap:
	(09:15:23) Removed more auto-generated files. 

	* configure.in,
	* progs/Makefile.am:
	(09:16:43) Further removal of libtool specific bits (AC_CHECK_LIB). 

	* Makefile:
	(16:03:35) Fixed bug with IOLIB_ZTR vs IOLIB_SFF macro. 

	* Makefile.am,
	* bootstrap,
	* configure.in,
	* read/Read.h,
	* utils/compress.c:
	(16:04:48) Replaced automake's generated config.h file
	io_lib_config and allow for it to be installed with "make install". 

	* progs/Makefile.am:
	(16:05:19) Added append_sff to the targets. 

	* read/translate.c:
	(16:05:42) Disabled asserts 

	* utils/mFILE.c:
	(16:06:25) Fixed bug in mfgetc when dealing with 8-bit data. It
	always now returns unsigned values except when EOF 

	* utils/open_trace_file.c:
	(16:07:20) Updated TAR magic number to be just the 5 first bytes as
	the 6th differs between systems (space vs nul). 

2005-10-20  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* sff/sff.c:
	(13:31:22) Split the read functions into read & decode functions so
	that we can unpack SFF structs from other sources. 

	* progs/Makefile,
	* progs/append_sff.c:
	(13:31:58) Added an append_sff.c program, to combine multiple SFF
	archives into a single archive. 

2005-10-18  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/convert_trace.c:
	(16:41:44) Modified to check RAWDATA search path when loading
	traces. 

	* progs/hash_sff.c:
	(16:42:58) Major overhaul to not load the entire SFF file into
	memory. It also handles copying the SFF file to a new file and
	adding an index to an SFF archive that already has an index. 

	* sff/sff.c,
	* sff/sff.h:
	(16:44:31) Restructured read functions to load & decode functions
	so we can decode SFF data blocks obtained via other means (eg as
	used in the indexing code). 

	* utils/open_trace_file.c:
	(16:45:42) Added SFF "sorted index" code, based on 454's getsff.c
	implementation. Also restructured the SFF querying code a bit so
	that it caches this data. 

2005-10-14  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* CHANGES:
	(16:07:36) *** empty log message *** 

	* exp_file/expFileIO.c:
	(16:08:32) Renamed _MSV_VER to _WIN32 so that the binary/ascii
	conversions for experiment file IO works once more under Windows. 

	* progs/Makefile,
	* progs/Makefile.am,
	* progs/hash_sff.c:
	(16:09:08) Added hash_sff program. This adds a .hsh format index to
	the SFF container. 

	* sff/sff.c,
	* sff/sff.h:
	(16:10:10) A total rewrite of the SFF code due to the recent
	changes in file format. This code handles access of a *single* SFF
	entry. The code to manipulate multi-file SFF (ie the container) is
	in open_trace_file.c. 

	* utils/hash_table.c,
	* utils/hash_table.h:
	(16:11:33) HashFileSave now returns the length of the saved hash.
	
	HashFileFopen now sets afp by default to be the same as hfp. Extra
	checking has been added when closing these file pointers to ensure
	we don't close twice if they point to the same FILE*. 

	* utils/mFILE.c,
	* utils/mFILE.h:
	(16:12:58) Added an mfascii() function. This allows for changing
	from binary to ascii after a file has been opened. It should be
	called in place of where the windows-specific _set_mode() function
	would be used.
	
	There is currently no analagous ascii-to-binary conversion, but I
	have not yet found a need for it either. 

	* utils/mach-io.c,
	* utils/mach-io.h:
	(16:13:29) Added [bl]e_{read,write}_int_8 functions for use with
	8-byte data types found in SFF. 

	* utils/open_trace_file.c:
	(16:14:55) Added a SFF= format for the RAWDATA search path. This
	handles the SFF container in much the same way that TAR= and HASH=
	works.
	
	Also for all three of these types you can now do archive/entry
	instead. Eg "extract_seq traces.tar/xyz.ztr" will work and it'll
	even look for traces.tar in RAWDATA if required. 

	* utils/os.h:
	(16:15:19) Added a uint1 typedef for completeness. 

	* Makefile.am,
	* read/Makefile.am:
	(16:16:06) Makefile support for new sff.c files. 

	* dependencies:
	(16:16:23) *** empty log message *** 

	* configure.in:
	(16:16:43) Updated to version 1.9.1. 

2005-10-04  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* Makefile:
	(08:54:30) Added sff to make distsrc 

	* utils/hash_table.c:
	(11:34:03) Cast ptrdiff_t value to int for %.*s argument. 

2005-09-29  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* utils/hash_table.c,
	* utils/hash_table.h:
	(16:04:06) Fixed the hash file saving and loading so that it works
	on all platforms instead of just x86 linux. There were bugs in
	assuming the size of structures. The assumptions are still there in
	that I assume they pad the same internally (for ease of coding - we
	can change it when we finally see a system which operates
	differently), but the final "boundary" padding has been resolved. 

2005-09-28  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/hash_list.c:
	(10:16:49) *** empty log message *** 

2005-09-19  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* utils/compress.c:
	(13:58:02) Fixed a file descriptor (and some memory) leak in
	freopen_compressed. (Bug ID 1289095) 

2005-09-08  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* ztr/ztr.c,
	* ztr/ztr_translate.c:
	(11:29:06) Don't try to compress SAMP chunks with meta-data PYRW as
	the raw pyrosequencing data from 454 doesn't compress. 

	* progs/Makefile,
	* progs/hash_tar.c,
	* utils/Hash_File_Format,
	* utils/hash_table.c,
	* utils/hash_table.h:
	(11:30:56) Changed the HashFile format slightly. It's now format
	1.00.
	
	The key difference is that it has a file footer pointing back to
	the hashfile header (so the hashfile can be appended to an archive)
	and it also has an offset in the header to apply to all seeks
	within the archive itself, so it can be prepending to an archive
	that's already been indexed without breaking the offsets.
	
	Extended the hash_tar program to allow control over these header
	options. 

2005-08-26  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* dependencies:
	(08:24:32) Rebuilt 

2005-08-25  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/makeSCF.c,
	* ztr/ztr.c:
	(10:22:20) General code tidyup to prevent warnings. 

2005-08-15  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* utils/hash_table.c:
	(15:25:18) Fixed HashTableLoad so it correctly stores the HashTable
	in the HashFile structure. It also now checks for the correct size
	of file to load. 

	* sff/sff.c,
	* sff/sff.h:
	(15:25:44) Added SFF (454 flowgram) file reading support. 

2005-08-10  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* Makefile,
	* README,
	* options.mk:
	(15:15:24) Added draft SFF format support. I need to verify if the
	example data files I tested this with are correct or if the SFF
	draft spec is correct (as they differ marginally in places). Hence
	this format may change soon. 

	* read/Read.c,
	* read/Read.h,
	* utils/traceType.c:
	(15:15:25) Added draft SFF format support. I need to verify if the
	example data files I tested this with are correct or if the SFF
	draft spec is correct (as they differ marginally in places). Hence
	this format may change soon. 

	* progs/ztr_dump.c:
	(15:16:31) Added (commented out) code for extra debugging. 

	* progs/Makefile:
	(15:16:48) Added hash_extract to the Makefile. 

2005-07-22  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* utils/compress.c:
	(15:52:07) Unset compression_used when opening uncompressed files
	instead of leaving as the last value. 

2005-07-15  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* read/Read.c:
	(15:16:58) Removed file descriptor 'leak' in write_reading(). 

2005-07-14  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* exp_file/expFileIO.c:
	(13:53:45) Commenting only 

	* read/Read.c,
	* utils/mFILE.c:
	(13:54:54) mfopen now honours binary verses ascii differences (and
	so updated Read.c calls accordingly) so that Windows works better.
	
	Also improved append mode of opening. 

2005-07-13  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* ztr/ztr.c:
	(08:41:16) Removed the warning for unknown chunk types. It now just
	silently stores them in memory. 

2005-07-11  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* utils/mFILE.c:
	(14:01:50) Fixed divide-by-zero buf when calling mfread for zero
	bytes. 

	* read/Read.c:
	(16:07:38) Fixed IO_LIB_* macros to be IOLIB_* macros. 

2005-07-07  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* Makefile.am:
	* progs/Makefile.am:
	(09:01:50) Removed libtool requirements. 

	* configure.in:
	(09:02:07) Removed use of libtool.

	(09:09:50) Removed as these have now been collapsed into the
	read/Makefile.am. 

	* README:
	(09:10:19) *** empty log message *** 

	* read/Makefile.am:
	(09:12:18) Subsumed the other */Makefile.am files. 

	* progs/hash_tar.c:
	(09:12:48) On Windows, set stdout to be _O_BINARY. 

	* read/Read.c:
	(09:13:22) Fixed the _O_BINARY setting code on windows to check for
	fp being valid and to use the mf->fp instead of fp. 

	* utils/compress.c:
	(09:15:30) Added checks for HAVE_SYS_WAIT_H for Windows handling. 

	* utils/compress.c:
	(09:20:04) Moved HAVE_ZLIB_H from compress.c and put in os.h (when
	autoconf is not in use). 

	* utils/hash_table.c:
	(09:21:45) Changed bucket_pos from int64_t to int32_t (as was
	intended) so it works on windows correctly. 

	* utils/mFILE.c:
	(09:22:50) Added more _O_BINARY checks for windows. 

	* utils/open_trace_file.c:
	(09:23:28) Added error checking in open_trace_file(). 

	* bootstrap:
	(10:28:38) Added to simplify initialisation of the autoconf system. 

	* utils/os.h:
	(10:34:54) Moved os.h from include to utils. 

	* Makefile.am:
	(10:49:17) Fixed missing backslash in pkginclude_HEADERS. 

	* Attic/config.guess,
	* Attic/config.sub,
	* Attic/ltconfig,
	* Attic/mkinstalldirs,
	* Attic/stamp-h.in:
	(10:55:09) Removed more auto-generated files from CVS tree. 

	* read/Read.h:
	(14:28:29) *** empty log message *** 

2005-07-04  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	(09:24:50) *** empty log message *** 

	* Makefile.am,
	* progs/Makefile.am,
	* read/Makefile.am,
	* scf/Attic/Makefile.am,
	* utils/Attic/Makefile.am:
	(09:25:34) Adjusted EXTRA_DIST definitions to only include files we
	still appear to have! 

	* Attic/Makefile.in,
	* progs/Attic/Makefile.in:
	* read/Attic/Makefile.in,
	* scf/Attic/Makefile.in,
	* utils/Attic/Makefile.in:
	* Attic/config.h.in,
	* Attic/configure:
	* configure.in:
	(09:27:05) Updated to use newer AC_INIT syntax. 

	* read/Read.c:
	(10:21:50) Made the default output format ZTR. Do not compress
	output (via gzip for example) if ZTR2 or ZTR3 is used. 

	* utils/compress.c:
	(10:25:19) If HAVE_ZLIB isn't defined then the memgzip/memgunzip
	functions are now also not built (and hence removes compilation
	errors).
	
	The pipe2 function now uses waitpid to avoid zombies. 

	* utils/mFILE.c,
	* utils/mFILE.h:
	(10:29:41) Added mfrecreate() function to	change an existing
	mFILE to point to new data. Better handling of append mode in
	mfreopen. Fixed mf->fname such that it's now always a pointer to
	malloced data. Added mfdestroy to deallocate memory, but without
	flushing or closing file descriptors. Changed mfflush to write data
	regardless of whether it's stdin/stdout. This means that
	mfflush+mfdestroy can be used to close	 an mFILE without closing
	the underlying FILE pointer used. Added mftruncate. Rewrote mfread
	to do a single memcpy instead of   looped  memcpys.

2005-06-29  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* CHANGES,
	* Makefile,
	* README,
	* dependencies:
	(13:33:14) Version 1.9.0-test
	
	* Significant speed ups, particularly when dealing with reading	 
	gzipped files or when extracting data from tar files.
	
	* New external functions for faster access via mFILE (memory-file) 
	 structs. These mimic the fread/fwrite calls, but with
	mfread/mfwrite	 etc.
	
	* Some functions previously available in external scope, but not  
	defined in header files, have now been made internal only  
	("static"). Please contact me if you were using these and have a  
	burning need for them to remain external.
	
	* Numerous minor tweaks and updates to fix compiler warnings on
	more   stricter modes of the Intel C Compiler.
	
	* Preliminary support for storing pyrosequencing style traces. This
	  has been modeled on the flowgram data from 454, but should be	 
	applicable to other platforms. ZTR has been updated to incorporate 
	 this too.
	
	  The Read structure also has flow, flow_order, nflows and flow_raw
	  elements too. Code to convert these into the more usual
	traceA/C/G/T   arrays exists currently as part of Trev (in tk_utils
	in the Staden	Package), but this may move into io_lib for the
	next official	release.
	
	* New hash_tar and hash_extract programs. These replace the
	index_tar   program for rast random access. For RAWDATA include
	"HASH=hashfile"	  as an element to get io_lib to use the archive
	hash. It's possible   to create hash files of most archive formats
	as the hash itself   contains the offset and size of each item in
	the archive. This means	  that extracting an item does not need to
	know the format of the	 original archive.
	
	  Some benchmarks show that on ext3 it's actually faster to extract
	  files from the hash than directly via the directory. This was	 
	testing with ~200,000 files, whereupon directory lookups become	 
	slow. I'd imagine ResierFS or similar to be faster.
	
	* Added an XRLE encoding for ZTR. This is similar to the existing
	RLE   mechanism but it copes with run length encoding of items
	larger than   a single byte. It's current use is for storing the
	4-base repeating   flow order in 454 data.
	
	* Potential incompatibilities:
	
	  - The Exp_info structure now has an "mFILE *fp" member instead of
	    "FILE *fp".
	
	  - As mentioned above, some functions are no longer external.
	These	  include many ctf functions, ztr_(de)compress,	   
	ztr_chunk_(read/write), be_read_*, be_write_*,
	
	  - The default search order for RAWDATA is that the current
	directory     is searched after the rest of rawdata instead of
	before.
	
	  - Removed support for the old unix "pack" program as a
	compression	tool.

	  - The Exp_info structure now has an "mFILE *fp" member instead of
	    "FILE *fp".
	
	  - As mentioned above, some functions are no longer external.
	These	  include many ctf functions, ztr_(de)compress,	   
	ztr_chunk_(read/write), be_read_*, be_write_*,
	
	  - The default search order for RAWDATA is that the current
	directory     is searched after the rest of rawdata instead of
	before.
	
	  - Removed support for the old unix "pack" program as a
	compression	tool. 

	* utils/vlen.c,
	* utils/vlen.h:
	(13:35:42) vlen/vflen functions to estimate the maximum data size
	written out by a printf style function. This is used by the new
	mFILE functions. 

	* utils/mFILE.c,
	* utils/mFILE.h:
	(13:39:13) mFILE struct support. This is basically a set of
	functions to similulate stdio file support on a block of memory
	instead of a file, for purposes of speed and to avoid the need of
	writing data out to a file only to be opened and read back in again
	(which happened a lot before).
	
	stdio_hack.h is, like it says, a hacky bunch of #defines to turn
	stdio functions and io_lib functions into their mFILE equivalents.
	It is used internally to convert old code (eg ABI file reading) to
	use mFILE structures, but can also be used by the brave to update
	their own code. Use with extreme caution. 

	* utils/stdio_hack.h:
	(13:39:14) mFILE struct support. This is basically a set of

	writing data out to a file only to be opened and read back in again

2005-06-08  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* utils/hash_table.c:
	* utils/hash_table.h:
	* progs/hash_extract.c,
	* progs/hash_tar.c:
	(08:37:49) Added some simple hash table functions. Layered on top
	of these are HashFiles, which allow hash table indexing of files to
	be stored on disk. hash_tar and hash_extract test programs
	illustrate its use on tar files, much like index_tar does. 

	* utils/open_trace_file.c:
	(08:38:22) Added support for integrating the new hashfile code via
	a "HASH=hashfile" RAWDATA setting. 

2005-04-27  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/get_comment.c:
	(16:15:51) Removed "might be used uninitialised" warning messages
	from the compiler. 

2005-02-09  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* abi/seqIOABI.c:
	(10:08:03) Added getABIIndexEntrySW and modified getABIString to
	correctly determine the string type (pascal vs C-string). This
	means MODL numbers now come out as 3730 instead of 730 (for
	example). 

2004-12-06  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/ztr_dump.c:
	(17:41:58) Corrected minor compiler warnings. 

2004-11-16  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* exp_file/expFileIO.c:
	(12:10:16) Major speed up of reading large experiment files. Tested
	on a 1Mb sequence with AV, ON and SQ lines the new code is 1000
	times faster on the Alpha.
	
	Primarily the difference comes from removing O(N^2) complexities by
	removing strcat & strlen type of operations. 

2004-10-29  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* Makefile:
	(10:42:10) Automatically create binary output directories. 

2004-10-21  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* dependencies:
	(11:39:28) *** empty log message *** 

2004-10-14  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/convert_trace.c:
	(15:38:18) Added a "-subtract <amount>" option to allow removal of
	a specific DC offset. 

2004-10-08  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/convert_trace.c:
	(14:49:06) Fixed a divide-by-zero error in the normalisation code. 

2004-10-01  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/convert_trace.c:
	(10:56:07) Rewrote rescale_heights (the "-normalise" option) using
	an amplitude tracker with an attack & delay model. This seems to
	work well at adjusting for both gradual amplitude variations and
	for downscaling huge dye-blobs. 

2004-08-17  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/Makefile,
	* progs/Makefile.am,
	* progs/ztr_dump.c:
	(13:37:17) Added a ztr_dump program. 

2004-08-05  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* progs/index_tar.c:
	(09:32:05) Fix bug submitted by Steve Leonard. If a directory is
	too large to fit in the name (>100) but short enough to fit in the
	prefix the name field will be empty, this is not the cas for
	ordinary files where the name field is always non-empty. 

2004-07-26  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* exp_file/expFileIO.c:
	(14:24:35) MinGW port 

	* utils/open_trace_file.c:
	(14:26:13) MinGW port

2004-05-13  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* abi/seqIOABI.c:
	(16:14:10) Improved spacing fix. 

2004-05-12  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* abi/seqIOABI.c:
	(08:27:40) Applied change suggested by Saul A. Kravitz. The
	fallback fspacing is now calculated over the range that basecalls
	exist rather than the total length of trace. 

2004-03-03  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* ztr/ztr_translate.c:
	(17:45:52) Treat Read->basePos as 16-bit, which means hard-coding
	the first two bytes in ztr_encode_positions for each pos as zero. 

2004-02-19  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* exp_file/expFileIO.c:
	(12:13:52) Fixed typo in LG qualifier (was LF). 

	* exp_file/expFileIO.h:
	(13:48:59) More type fixes; EFLT_LG was given the same number as
	_FT. Now diff.

	* exp_file/expFileIO.c,
	* exp_file/expFileIO.h:
	(14:39:52) Added LG (LiGation) to experiment file definition. 

2004-01-13  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* read/translate.c:
	(17:02:00) In read2exp only set the file format to be TT_EXP when
	'redirection to trace' is not enabled (ie it indicates where the
	sequence came from, EXP or SCF/ZTR/...). 

2003-11-17  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* utils/open_trace_file.c:
	(14:52:28) Added ARC= and URL= RAWDATA search methods to fetch
	traces via the ensembl trace archive and via a URL. 

2003-10-24  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* abi/seqIOABI.c:
	(08:24:07) Protect against the base spacing being listed as a
	negative number in the ABI file. 

	* progs/extract_seq.c:
	(08:24:29) Added a -fofn option 

	* utils/compress.c:
	(08:24:57) More error checking on writing compressed files. 

2003-07-10  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* Makefile:
	(11:14:14) Put back the Staden Makefile as I accidently overwrote
	this with the autoconf generate one.

	* Attic/stamp-h.in:
	(11:24:47) Added automake/autoconf/libtool files to CVS tree. Not
	all of these are 'source' files as some are generated by others,
	but for ease of compilation the output from these tools is
	distribute too, meaning that only './configure' needs to be run.
